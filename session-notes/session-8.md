# Key events

- The group restocks its travel gear, secures mounts from Naardor, asks him to finish the dungeon in their safehouse, and then says goodbye. On Gotnafiskr's behalf, Naardor will finish his favors for the PCs and then attempt to retire and disappear.
- Faelin researches the human invasion and finds evidence of human occupiers killing soma addicts and dealers by forced overdose in the early days after the conquest.
- The group leaves for Mount Cineris to pursue Jem Brighthelm, former Magmatic artifcer.
- At the base of Mount Cineris, near the path beginning its eastern approach, the group finds evidence of a camp and a cache of supplies. Faelin also sees magic streaming out of a fissure high up the mountain side.
- Faelin safely guides the group up the eastern face of the mountain while Kilvar scouts for trouble.
- Kilvar anticipates an ambush, and the group visciously slaughters the 4 dwarven cloaks who made up Jem's rearguard. Ob takes a mortal wound, but Faelin stabilizes him, spending a point of Risk to save his life.
- It's clear from their remaining gear that these dwarves set up the camp and cache at the base of the mountain. 
- Kilvar and Ob feel justified in the killings since they were attacked. Psalt and Wally have reservations about killing other dwarves on a campaign to rally the dwarves against the humans. Faelin is saddened to see so much loss of life and to anticipate more.
- The party completes its ascent to the fissure Faelin saw. It leads to a narrow tunnel. Kilvar scouts the tunnel and finds that it opens into a natural chamber in the mountainside holding a stone sarcophagus. This is the crypt of Aarok's last sleeping.
- Jem Brighthelm kneels in front of the sarcophagus, chanting something in ancient dwaven. She wears a full suit of dwarven plate and has a unique greatsword; its cleaver-like steel edge extends back into a messy fusion of steel and a massive red shard cystal that makes up the other half of the blade.
- Wally puts on his magic mask to impersonate Naardor. He corectly intuits that Naardor was above Jem's pay grade at Magmatic and had some kind of familiar relationship with her even if he didn't oversee the particulars of her project.
- Jem is distraught that she cannot see how to open the sarcohpagus. She believes it holds Aarok's bones. It has been encrypted with Maze. She says she and Naardor are so close to getting what they want - a way to stop Root. 
- Jem is frequently confused by what she thinks are non-sequitors from Naardor, but Wally otherwise maintains his impersonation well enough during this moment of crisis for Jem that she thinks he is Naardor.
- Wally can see the true shape of the sarcophagus - he knows the key phrase to decrypt it. It looks like a massive, brutally-carved dwarf lying in repose.
- Wally begins tracing the seams of the lid on the sarcophagus to show Jem how to open it. The sarcophagus awakens and transforms into a stone Tomb Golem and begins attacking Wally and Jem.
- Psalt converts his armor into True-Name Plate and charges into battle shouting his true name for all to hear.
- The party quickly shatters the Golem, and it spills Aarok's bones. They are jumbled, charred, black, stinking, and oozing what seems to be marrow and other bits of viscera and tendons, as if the bones were trying to remake the body they inhabited. Root's ritual magic is likely summoning that last "fleshy" incarnation of Aarok back to life from these bones.
- Gotnafiskr warns that the bones must be protected. They say any dwarf who carries all of them will have increased powers of persuasion over other dwarves.
- Psalt tells the group to divvy up the bones bewteen each member of the party so no single party members gets the power of the bones.
- Kilvar grabs Jem's arm to reveal that she has the Aarok tattoo. Jem pulls away and begins raising her crystal cleaver.

# Key understandings

- Root's ritual magic to raise Aarok continues.
- Root is nearly ready to send his caravan of Black Masks west towards the homelands.
- Jem seems to know and trust Naardor and to be against Root for similar reasons.
- Aarok's bones have great power, and Gotnafiskr wants them preserved.
- Risk is at 27%.
- Magmatic Risk is at 13%.

# Key decisions

- How to deescalate the situation with Jem in the crypt.
- How to walk back Wally's impersonation of Naardor.
- What to ask Jem.
- What to do with Jem.
- How to confront Root.
