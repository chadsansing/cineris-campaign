# Key events

- The group heads west from Portia in pursuit of Jem and the small caravan. Everyone learns about one another. Kilvar dreams of Soma. Ob saves food in his beard. Psalt has fought alone in the past. Wally explains how different knots in dwarven beards denote seniority and ancestry. Faelin shares an elven prophecy that foretells of a costly war between the dwarves and humans. That war is predicted to pave the way for the elves to dominate Cineris.
- Gotnafiskr stright up hates Root and is unwilling to let him succeed in summoning Aarok or brining the dwarves to his side. They want Root stopped and killed. They do not accept Faelin's s suggestion to use Root's forces as the tip of the spear to weaken the humans or his suggestion that the humans be warned of Root's attack.
- Spies report. Nothing is happening at Kilvar's pass. The dwarves in the large caravan are converting their wagons to rafts at Ash Lake and sending an amphibious force down-river towards Visus. Nothing seems alarming in Denokta. Members of the cult of Aarok are being assigned to guard duty outside the ritual magic chamber beneath Stoneshaper Keep. They are on 4-hour shifts, once or twice daily. They have to report to 2 different supervisors every half hour. They report with Messenger to 1 and with a shard crystal to the other. A third supervisor delivers guards' individual keywords at the start of each shift.
- The group catches up to Jem. She agrees to send her irregulars to kidnap the caravan's rear-guard for questioning.
- Jem returns with 2 Magmatic cloaks.
- Wally unsuccessfuly tries to read their recent activity by using Psychometry on one of their cowls.
- After putting up resistance, one cloak passes out from blood-loss after Kilvar attempts to torture him in response to a counter-offer for his freedom. The other resists questioning, but succumbs to Faelin's Mind Read.
- The group learns that the small caravan carries a new kind of shard crystal that will let the Black Masks shard warp into Denokta. The Black Masks are hidden and dsitributed across wasteland Stranger communities right now.
- Jem and the group develop a plan to disable the lead wagon in the caravan and prevent it from reaching Visus. The group is compelled to ride with Jem; not even Psalt can resist her call to action and arms.
- Wally successfully casts Swarm Song to hide the noise of Jem's irregulars as they ride down the caravan. Then he casts Bloom Bomb to entangle and stop the lead wagon. Faelin tags the second wagon with a shard arrow.
- Jem's irregulars take on the guards from the first wagon; the party attacks the driver, captain, and guards of the second wagon.
- After an epic and bloody battle in which several party members received critical and mortal wounds, the Magmatic guards are defeated. Another 27 dwarves (between the Magmatic Guards and Jem's irregulars) are dead thanks to the group. Grievous harm. Sacrifice. Slow-motion stunts. It's all in there.
- Party members stabilize themselves and staunch their wounds.
- The wagons are carrying 6 chests each that the group has yet to open.
- The wagons also have false bottoms protected by Maze that Wally and Faelin decrypt and pry open.
- Each wagon has 2 cases of 20 Magmatic Black Oath shard crystals in velvet bags. Each bag is embroidered with gold thread and says, "Magmatic Black Oath," as well as, "Just say, 'and the stars will be your eyes,' to begin." Each bag also has a collector's number between 161/200 and 200/200.

# Key understandings

- Gotnafiskr is motivated by jealousy and the requirements of their role in dwaven ritual, religion, and magic. Reason is not their only motivation.
- The bones are changing Jem. Sootier. More cutthroat towards even dwarven enemies. Caught between an exaggerated follower role and absolutist commander role. Driven to act, act, act.
- A Magmatic amphibious force of +/- 500 regular houseguard and troops is punting down the Ash River towards Visus, presumably to seize control of the human district west of the river.
- Root's strike is imminent. He plans to ship a new kind of shard crystal - the Magmatic Black Oath - to Denokta that will allow the Black Masks to shard warp there through those crystals.
- Root's ritual magic team is in high gear summoning Aarok.
- The Black Masks are hidden and dsitrubted throughout Stranger communities in the wasteland.
- It's possible that 160 Magmatic Black Oath shard crystals (or more) are unaccounted for by the PCs at present.
- Jem's irregulars can raid, sabotage, surveil, and extract. She commands 17 irregulars at this point in time, losing 7 in the attack on the small caravan outside Visus.
- Risk is at 29%.
- Magmatic Risk is at 30%.

# Key decisions

- How long does Jem keep those bones?
- What does the group do with the 40 Magmatic Black Oath crystals in its possession?
- How should Gotnafiskr help in Visus? Should they act against the Magmatic amphibious force, the human side of the city, or both?
- When does the group go to Denokta?
- How should the group re-valuate use-of-force as its primary strategy (and torture as a secondary one) against increasignly capable Magmatic forces?
