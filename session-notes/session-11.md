# Key events

- While the group and Jem debate about what to do next, Psalt cold cocks Jem, knocking her out. He takes Aarok's bones from her and hands them to Faelin saying, "Since he is not a human, and he is not an elf, he must be a dwarf." This binds the irregulars to Faelin for as long as he holds the bones.
- The group discovers it has 12 chests full of uncut gems.
- Psalt suggests warning the humans or taking Stoneshaper Keep as ways to take matters into the PCs own hands and create some space between them and Aarok and Gotnafiskr. However, it's difficult to find a way to work against the humans, Root, and the gods all at once. The party agrees to travel with Jem to confront Root in Denokta before seeking its independence from Gotnafiskr's patronage.
- The group puts the Magmatic Black Oath crystals in the saddlebags of the ponies that survived the battle on the road to Visus and scatters them [so this set actually never made it to Denokta to be shattered].
- The PCs convince Gotnafiskr to flood the Ash River, delaying the dwarven amphibious force and scatterings its rafts on to the banks of the river upstream from Visus. This spares most of the dwarves, as well as the human district of Visus, from Gotnafiskr's impulse to destroy one or the other with a massive tidal wave.
- Jem, Faelin's irregulars, and the group begin heading west using the undamaged Magmatic wagon. They bribe their way through Visus and the border fort. 
- On the way, Ob and Kilvar discuss what it's like to be close to death, Psalt offers tactical advice to his comrades, and Wally compares Psalt to the mythic dwarven hero Baartok the Unmoveable.
- Between the fort and Denokta, 3 Risk Eaters attack the party. Wally snares 2 of the Risk Eaters with Bloom Bomb after they launch a volley of Kill Bolts at the PCs. Faelin orders his irregulars into battle. Between the PCs and their escort, they kill the Risk Eaters, losing 5 irregulars in the fight. 12 remain bound to the bones.
- The group moves on to Denokta and makes it through the customs check point after Wally convinces the guard that they were delayed and lost a wagon to brigands outside Lockton. Their nominal destination is a trade bank on the second level of the city.
- The group makes it to level 2, a warehouse level, with a large underground river surrounding the district and providing speedy transport between warehouses in a clockwise direction from northeast to northwest.
- As the group approaches the ramp between levels 2 and 3 of the city, Root launches his decapitation attack against the human government and elites on level 3. 
- Kilvar finds his sister among the Black Masks appearing shard-warping into Denokta above their marks on the ramp between levels 2 and 3. She communicates with him by mimicking the motions they used to make as children playing the dwarven game Crows' Bones. Kilvar confirms her identity with a Messenger spell. 
- The PCs understand the underground river surrounding level 2 and its warehouse district to be Gotnafiskr's sign.
- Kilvar breaks from the party to follow his sister to level 3. Jem wants to follow, find Root, and kill him.
- The party must decide whether to follow Kilvar or to try and follow the river.

# Key understandings

- Gotnafiskr is increasingly impatient and irrational in their quest to end Root and prevent him from summoning Aarok to his need.
- Root's attack has begun. He may be somewhere in Denokta.
- Root has been recruiting Strangers to be Black Masks, as well, as evidenced by Kilvar's sister.
- Dwarves bound to Aarok's Bones follow them between wielders, at least as long as they are predisposed to agree with each wielder's orders.
- The PCs have survived multiple Risk Eater attacks and are in the middle of a city beset by shard-warping dwarven assassins. The next Risk Eater attack is likely to be overwhelming, decisive, and aided by factions on Cineris that work with the Risk Eaters. It is a difficult time to risk losing Gotnafiskr's patronage.
- Risk is at 51%.
- Magmatic Risk is at 30%.
