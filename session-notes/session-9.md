# Key events

- Kilvar shows Jem his Aarok + Gotnafiskr tattoo, de-escalating the situation. Jem seems to know of Gotnafiskr and to believe that she and the group are on the same side.
- Throughout the encounter, Kilvar feels and hears activity on the mountain.
- Accidentally outed by Kilvar, Wally decides to end his impersonation of Naardor. 
- Kilvar gives Jem his blue crystal shard so she can confirm the group's good intent with Gotnafiskr; Naardor also chimes in on the network to assure Jem she can trust the other characters.
- Jem and the party enter into a stand-off over Aarok's bones.
- Gotnafiskr suggests that the PCs give Jem the bones so she can persuade potential dwarven allies to rally against Root. The party agrees.
- When Jem becomes the "keeper of the bones" and takes them up, dwarves in the group feel a strange compulsion to follow her.
- The group decides that when the characters split from Jem, they will go to Portia to try and stop Root's caravan from leaving for Denokta.
- As the party prepares to leave the crypt, two Magmatic scouts burst into the room.
- The group quickly eviscerates them, going so far as to execute one of the scouts after his surrender.
- After they get outside, Jem and the party see a troop of 50 Magmatic cloaks preparing to climb the eastern approach towards their position.
- Gotnafiskr declines to help the group decrypt bridged Magmatic traffic citing the importance of keeping their position hidden fron Root. Gotnafiskr cannot offer air support, either, from their current location.
- After evaluating other escape routes (a fissure in the crypt and a series of planned falls down the northern face of Mount Cineris), the group decides to go through the Magmatic cloaks.
- The group disguises Jem in salvaged clothing from one of the scouts, and Wally gives her his mask so she can impersonate him by staring at his severed head while she dons the mask. She carries Aarok's bones to help exert her will on the Magmatic cloaks.
- Jem descends the mountain with Ob, Kilvar, and Faelin trailing in support.
- Jem convinces the first group of cloaks she encounters that the group is gone and that the Magmatic troops need to return to Portia and warn Root.
- Jem has less luck convincing the rest of the cloaks and their commander down at their base camp. A handful of Magmatic cloaks and the commander don't believe that the party could have escaped without their notice.
- Psalt and Faelin use a combination of shardnet comms and arrows to incite a mutiny and melee among the Magmatic cloaks.
- Psalt rallies the group to his side, casts a siege shield, and pushes through the chaos.
- The party mounts its ponies and rides for Portia. Psalt leaves behind the red crystal shard he used to start the mutiny.
- Despite herself, Jem likes this invader Faelin.
- On the way home, Faelin shields a mysterious elvish beggar from Psalt's ire, and Kilvar and Ob reminisce over a dwarven childhood game called Crows' Bones (catch the crows, eat them, now you have some bones). Wally impersonates Kilvar, and Psalt dreams of flipping Stoneshaper Keep into a safe house.
- In Portia, Faelin learns that a pair of heavily guarded wagons left the West gate and headed towards Visus. 
- Psalt spends the last of his Magmatic money restocking the group's potions and arms. 
- The party gets an echo from Gotnafiskr asking them to stop by the docks. *The Weeping Angel* is there. Inside the captain's cabin is a note from Naardor, a pair of ancient dwarven forge master gloves for Wally (so he can wield Aarok's sword), and a pair of camouflage cloaks - one is Petra's original prototype and the other is something one of Gotnafiskr's other agents must have reverse-engineered. Wally takes one; Psalt takes the other. Kilvar takes another blue shard crystal from the necklace on the ship's figurehead.
- Jem leaves to call in her favors in Portia; then she heads west to recruit more fighters from Visus. She still has the blue crystal shard she took from Kilvar in the crypt.
- The group's spy in Magmatic's Aarok cult reports that he heard nothing about a caravan leaving the west gate, but that he had to help prepare a caravan of a few dozen wagons and about 500 troops and support staff that left through the north gate. He doesn't know where they were headed. He us in a thrall-like stage of initiation at this point, expected to be obedient, rather than informed.
- The party hires elvish scouts to watch Kilvar's pass.
- It also hires dwarven scouts to find the northern caravan.
- The group also employs a spy from within the halls of power in Denokta.
- The group asks Jem to pick up her pace and find the small caravan before it reaches Visus; the group plans to follow.
- Jem has recruited 24 cloaks and agents so far from Portia. They are all in pursuit of the small caravan.
- The party is ready to leave Portia and pursue the small caravan, as well.


# Key understandings

- Aarok's bones and the camouflage cloaks are powerful artifacts.
- The small caravan may be carrying doors to shadow chambers full of Black Masks.
- The large caravan will have to turn south at some point, unless Root is sending it towards the elvish forest, which doesn't fit with anything the party knows about his ambitions or plans.
- Jem and her irregulars will be a mercenary company the group can use as a strategic asset beginning next session.
- The group's new motto is *mori, podex*.
- Risk is at 28%.
- Magmatic Risk is at 25%.

# Key decisions

- What will the party do with the small caravan if they find it?
- What will the party do about the large caravan?
- How will the group find and deal with Root and whatever he's summoning?
- Should the group go to Denokta to find Gotnafiskr's sign?
- Is Jem going to hold on to those bones forever?
