# Key events

- The group activates its spy at Magmatic and instructs them to infiltrate the cult of Aarok.
- While the group contemplates its allegiance and next moves, a Risk Eater appears from the shard scape chamber/sewer entrance and attacks.
- Inspired by the battlebond between Kilvar and Ob, the group slaughters the Risk Eater. Wally successfully casts Bloom Bomb, but the Risk Eater and Ob shake it off. Psalt gores its ribs; Kilvar lops off its left arm and leg; Faelin stabs it in the soft underside of its chin; Ob sneezes on it.
- Wally raises Aarok's Sword during the battle. It glows white hot, startling him and blistering his hand. He drops the sword on his shoulder and takes a critical burn wound.
- The Risk Eater, partially dismembered by Kilvar, attempts to unleash a Kill Ball on the group, but loses control of the magic. It manifests inside of the Risk Eater's chest and explodes it.
- Kilvar and Ob deepen their bond through a post-battle grooming ritual.
- After healing, Wally casts Psychometry on the Risk Eater's sword, but is unable to learn anything important.
- Kilvar works on more traps to secure the safe house. Psalt and Ob clean up the Risk Eater. Faelin helps Wally get comfortable in the library and assists Wally with his research on Gotnafiskr.
- Wally works through a series of near-ancient texts going back as far as a millenium before the shard catastrophe to the time of King Ruundum who apprently worshipped and worked with both Aarok and Gotnafiskr. Wally has not tried to read any of the more difficult and incomplete ancient texts yet.
- After learning more about Gotnafiskr, the group confronts Dril via their shards and confirms that Dril is Gotnafiskr.
- Faelin leads the interview.
- Gotnafiskr resents Root for trying to bind Aarok to Root's needs over the needs of all dwarves. Gotnafiskr wants to destroy Root and finish Aarok's work to drive out the humans. It's like Gotnafiskr has to do this because Root has summoned Aarok to do this, but Gotnafiskr either wants Aarok to be free or bound to Gotnafiskr's or the dwarves' needs, not Root's.
- Gotnafiskr is opposed to Root and parts of his work, but not to his goal. Gotnafiskr cites Root's hubris in:
  - Worshipping only Aarok and relying on "tricks" instead of dwarven tradition. There may be some pride at play here.
  - Attempting to bind Aarok to his will, not the needs of all dwarves, in effect also stealing Aarok from Gotnafiskr.
  - Taking shortcuts, like the Black Masks, that destroy dwarven identity and lives.
- Gotnafiskr shares intelligence about Root, his sped-up timetable, and the remaining artificers.
- Gotnafiskr offers the group these choices:
  - Help Root, and become Gotnafiskr's enemy.
  - Kill Root and take over his more traditional forces and technologies to drive out the humans.
  - Beat Root to Denokta, his new target for a Black Mask-led decapitation attack, and find the sign they need to know Gotnafiskr is real.
  - Take time to track down 1 last artificer and learn more of Root's design before acting against him.
- After listening to Gotnafiskr, the group decides it has time to track down one last artificer (out of 3 remaining at-large), Jem Brightblade, before either moving against Root or beating him to his target: Denokta, the human-held capital of the homelands that spans above and below ground.
- Jem is climbing Mount Cineris, looking for the crypt of Aarok's last sleeping.

# Key understandings

- Dril is Gotnafiskr.
- Faelin correctly intuits that aspects and genders are either fluid or not applicable to Gotnafiskr and, perhaps, Aarok. They may be two aspects of the same being or force or an archetypical pairing.
- Dragons haven't been sighted on Cineris since the time of King Runndum.
- Aarok and Gotnafiskr have appeared in many forms with many names or epithets over the ages; however, the name Dril doesn't show up in near-ancient lore.
- Gotnafiskr is bound to Aarok's Jealousy - whenever someone touches Gotnafiskr or a representation of Gotnafiskr, that person's fingers bleed.
- Aarok is bound to Gotnafiskr's Jealousy - whatever Aarok begins, Gotnafiskr is compelled to end.
- Aarok and Gotnafiskr were once regarded as the parents of the dwarves.
- They engage in a cycle of beginnings, invention according to need, tempering according to tradition, and endings. What Aarok begins, Gotnafiskr must end. Not all of them are good; not all of them are bad. This can apply to things like war, but also to things like bringing a prototype to market.
- Part of their work seems to be in manufacturing crises or trials for the dwarves. This is because Gotnafiskr believes they will have to end the dwarves unless they perpetually give the dwarves other beginnings and endings. Gotnafiskr can see a day when there are no more dwarves on Cineris.
- Gotnafiskr is neither free nor not free, but their sign can be seen somewhere in Denokta.
- Aarok's Sword takes special handling to wield because it glows white-hot when swung.
- Root has sped up his timetable. His agents are waking the Black Mask sleepers in Stranger communities. He's preparing a caravan at Stoneshaper Keep. His plan seems to be to have his Black Masks infiltrate Denokta using some kind of stealth technology in order to assisnate the ruling class, Denokata's military leaders, and all their families (or at least that's what Psalt would do). It's a matter of weeks, not months, until Root can mobilize the caravan.
- Faelin is in an increasingly compromised position that requires him to deal with his human heritage.
- Normal risk is at 26%.
- Magmatic risk is at 13%.
