# Key events

- Kilvar follows his sister down the ramp towards level 3 of Denokta. Eventually, he catches her, they reconcile and agree to find Kilvar's friends. Root, the Red Mask, and the Silver Mask spot them and hound them down through the depths of Denokta until they reach King Runduum's Hall.
- The rest of the party risks the underground river flowing down from level 2 and ride its currents into depths and darkness. They eventually land in the Chamber of Need.
- Everyone but Faelin reists touching one of the soul shards in the Chamber of Need. The soul shards are a storage medium engineered by King Runduum's to hold the essence of heroes - volunteers and prisoners - in case the dwarves need them in later ages.
- Faelin touches a shard and exchanges a bit of his soul for that of Radian Stoneheart, an elvish champion who helped the dwarves fight off an undead menace deep below Denokta in King Runduum's age. Radian believed the undead threatened the eleves and helped even though the other elves refused to get involved. Radian was exiled by the elves for helping the dwarves and lived the rest of his life among the dwarves. Faelin gained some of Radian's valor and resolve, sacrificing his own innocence in return. Faelin is changed and more of a ditant leader as a result; he also has 2 soul names now.
- The party moves from the Chamber of Need to King Runduum's Hall where th PCs encounter King Runduum and his court as iron seneschals, immobile, iron-wrought seers of a past age.
- The court includes:
  - Goterdrum, king's artificer.
  - Loda, captain of the Stoneguard.
  - Baligbak, historian of needs.
  - Ruundum, king of dwarves.
- The party answers the sensechals' questions, and the seneschals unlock the city of Aarok, sending magma from King Runduum's Hall through a network of miles-long, ancient, dwarven-engineered tunnels that reach below Black Lake, boil the water at its underground source, and use the resultant steam to raise the City of Aarok up through the lake.
- As the magma drains from King Runduum's Hall into the network of tunnels leading to Black Lake, Kilvar and his sister burst into the chamber from a side entrance, pursued by Root, the Red Mask, and the Silver Mask.
- Root attempts to convince the party to rejoin his cause and to assert mortal, dwarven authority over Cineris with Aarok as the dwarves' muse.
- The party declines his invitation.
- After nearly dying, Kilvar fights back with the help of his friends, Jem, and the irregulars. They defeat the masks. 
- Ob finishes Root with a punching dagger after Jem and Kilvar pin him between attacks.
- Gotnafiskr rises from the magma in their serpent form, finally freed from the magma tunnels in which they slept ever since the end of King Runduum's age. They bite Root in half. The masks mourn him before they, too, die from their wounds. 
- Wally reads one of their masks to discover that the Red and Silver Masks were Root's daughters and victims of his first attempts to prototype the Stranger-like Black Masks.
- Gotnafiskr summons the party to the City of Aarok at Black Lake. They take Aarok's bones from Faelin and out them into Aarok's iron senseschal form.
- Gotnafiskr offers each PC the choice of serving Aarok and Gotnafiskr further or of departing with a gift. 
- Faelin stays to serve as an ambassador to the humans and to negotiate a merciful surrender for them; it's likely that Radian's past with Runduum, Aarok, and Gotnafiskr also influences his decision. 
- The others all leave with gifts from Gotnafiskr, eager to learn more about their places in the world and to serve as foils against Gotnafiskr's ambition.
  - Psalt leaves for Sphere to begin training dwarves to resist Gotnafiskr. He leaves with a twine necklace and small leather pouch carrying the last of the ashes of Aarok's Bones.
  - Wally leaves to find other dwarven gods sleeping on Cineris. He leaves with a copy of King Runduum's biography encrypted so he can read the ancient dwarven text with ease.
  - Kilvar leaves with his sister to look for a way to restore her identity. He leaves with a dagger carved from one of Gotnafiskr's old scales that carries their essence and can decrypt, by touch, anything Gotnafiskr can decrypt.
  - Ob leaves to grapple things, maybe start a new career. He leaves with a spiked gauntlet made from the teeth of Gotnafiskr's last serpent form.

# Key understandings

- Root's decapitation attack on Denokta was a success, despite his death, throwing the humans into disarray and panic. Many have fled the city for other human settlements in the dwarven homelands.
- Root had a plan - or agreement - in place to keep the Risk Eaters off his back and, largely, off Cineris. That agreement may no longer be in effect after his death.
- Ob made a contract with himself to kill Root.
- Gotnafiskr has assumed authority over the dwarves and their expulsion of the humans from the dwarven homelands.
- Gotnafiskr has assumed a new, martial form of a 9' merfolk in blue and green scaled armor with lines of air- and water-breathing gills in place of their mouth and nose.
- Gotnafiskr is using Jem to rally the dwarves to the City of Aarok at Black Lake.
- Gotnafiskr is using Faelin to offer mericiful terms of surrender and exile to the humans. Maybe they will leave for Sphere. Maybe they will move into the wasteland, relinquishing the homelands. Maybe they will fight.
- The City of Aarok is a massive, steam-powered home and workshop for the dwarves of Cineris to use as they take back the homelands.
- Aarok has become an iron seneschal overlooking his city at Black Lake to serve the needs of all dwarves who want to expel the humans from Cineris. Gotnafiskr's throne is next to his at the top of the hill city.
- Apart from Faelin, the PCs are ready to end their service to Gotnafiskr, though they all carry great Risk going forward.
- Naardor, Embery, and Cantor have all gone to Sphere to serve as advance agents for Gotnafiskr when they are ready to address the Risk Eater threat.
- One day, in a moment of crisis, someone might discover and embrace a bit of Faelin's soul from a spirit shard in the Chamber of Need, gaining his hope and healing skills in exchange for something of their own.
