### Important NPCs

#### Jem Brighthelm

Jem is a fighter, weapons designer, and former Magmatic artificer. She was part of Root's Aarok cult, but became both jealous of Root and upset with his obsession with technology, his willingness to sacrice dwarves' identities to create the Black Masks, and his plan to take on the Risk Eaters and humans at once. She has more intelligence on Root's plan than anyone not still inside Magmatic. She knows Root wanted to attack the humans with conventional forces and then strike the Risk Eaters on Sphere through smuggled shards. She has heard someone is messing with Root's plans and that he has had to change them, but she has been gone long enough so that she doesn't know what his current plans are.

Jem wants to:

- Raise Aarok.
- Prove herself worthy to be Aarok's chief priest and lieutenant over Root.
- Kill Root, if necessary.
- Follow Aarok to drive out the humans.

Jem is climbing Mount Cineris with her personal guard to find the crypt of Aarok's last sleeping, which should hold the bones of his last dwarven avatar.

If defeated and spared or given the chance to negotiate, Jem will follow the PCs if they convince her that they serve Aarok or Aarok and Gotnafiskr; she would rather die following a leader to drive out the humans than needlessly in an unimportant battle. If she is defeated and spared or if the PCs reach a deal with her, Jem can become:

- An NPC general of conventional dwarven forces she can raise apart from the general population and anti-Root sympathizers at Magmatic. She can raise about 50 irregular cloaks and fighters or 200-300  regular troops from her clan, Naardor's house guard, the general populace, and defectors from the ranks of Magmatic executives, employees, and guards.
- An NPC general of the Black Masks if Gotnafiskr and the PCs can free them fom Root's influence (raising the City of Aarok will be enough to sway most dwarves, even conditioned ones, to Gotnafiskr and the PCs). There are approximately 100 Black Masks.
- A cel capable of successful raids on trivial and challenging targets and capable of successful sucide missions on tough targets. Combinging Jem with another cel on a suicide mission will reduce its difficulty from tough to to challenging.
- A playable PC if one of the other PCs (cough, cough, Faelin) dies or leaves during this session.

Jem has the prototype steel and red crystal sword known as the Bloody Warden. It absorbs the soul name of its last victim; its weilder can then attempt to decrypt anything they read that's been encrypted with the victim's true name. It's a +2 damage, overwhelming, macabre claymore that glows red and seems to have the outline of its last victim dsparately trying to climb out of the blade if you look at it with Astral Eyes.

## Story

### Background

The group has found Jem and defeated the Tomb Golem holding Aarok's bones, a powerful totemic artifact that gives any dwarven wielder the ability to rally other dwarves to their cause. The bones also seem to be trying to re-grow Aarok from the inside out; the group has separated the bones so each group member carries some of Aarok.

Somehow, the group has to decide what to do with Jem and how to confront Root as time has run out - his caravan is starting for Denokta. Wally is still impersonating Naardor' Jem's rearguard is still daed; Faelin is still human; something is coming up Mount Cineris.

### Scenes

#### Parley with Jem

Jem is thankful for the group's help in defeating the Tomb Golem and freeing Aarok's bones. She is now confused by Kilvar's aggrevssive arm grab and Wally's inconsistent impersonation of Naardor "Old Naardo" Gearsmith.

If she believes the group is a danger, Jem will fight. She will not accept an outcome that puts Aarok's bones into unworthy hands. However, she is open to parley; she is impressed with the group's fighting ability and considers Naardor to be an ally in her fight to usurp Root and his perverse ways (e.g. making Black Masks) before dealing with the humans.

The PCs will have to figure out how to walk back Wally's impersonation and their slaughter of Jem's rearguard.

If Jem sees the Aarok + Gotnafiskr tattoo, she will call for negotiations and explain that Naardor had shown her that tattoo, but they decided she should keep the Aarok tattoo to better infilitrate Root's inner circle, uncover his plans, and learn the location of assets they could use to defeat him. The artificers were a kind of loosley federated fellowship dedicated to escaping, weakening, or defeating Root, though there's word that Hamner set out on his own as a mercenary to sell the tech he took.

Jem will want to take the bones with her to raise an army against Root. She promises that she and her army would then serve the PCs and go where they tell her to go and take the objectiv they tell her to take. Jem will say she can do this without the bones, but she will rely on her friends and contacts to form a small group of irregulars (totalling 50 or so) that will be nimbler than a larger force, but also weaker. With the bones, she is confident she can raise hundreds of cloaks and soldiers to challenge Root, wage guerilla strikes on his forces, or hold a position against them.

If Jem is put into contact with Gotnafiskr via shard network, Gotnfiskr will recruit her towards one of those ends and ask the group to empower Jem to act on their behalf. Jem can take one of their shards; Gotnafiskr will send *The Weeping Angel* to Portia or the sea cave outside Visus to bring the PCs another and resources for the next step of their journey.

The PCs should decide:

- What to do with Jem and her sword.
- What to do with Aarok's bones.
- Where to pursue Root.

The PCs should also improvise a way to wield Aarok's Sword, at some point; maybe Gotnafiskr will ship some ancient dwarven forgemaster gautnlets on the *Angel*, as well.

**Camouflage cloak**

- +1 success on Stealth rolls
- Ignore 1 botch on Stealth rolls

#### Escaping Mount Cineris

Once the PCs leave the crypt of Aarok's last sleeping, they will immediately see a large force of Magmatic cloaks climbing the east approach towards their position. There are approximately 50 cloaks headed up the mountain. 

The PCs can try to fight, look for a way out through the crypt, defend the crypt, or scamble down the north face of the mountain towards the dead ring of the elvish forest. They may be able to stay ahead of the cloaks and hire Gigaphids to get them back to Portia or the Visus safehouse.

***If the PCs look for a way out through the crypt,*** they will find a crack they break open into a crevasse without knowing where it goes; it is not big enough for them to move through unless they leave gear and belly crawl. Faelin may not fit. Everyone who wants to go needs to make a willpower check. A weapon and an item can go with each character, shoved ahead or tied to a foot. The crevasse will open onto an underground part of the Dead River, which will eventually sweep the PCs back out into the wasteland if they survive the journey. The jump into the river will take an acrobatics roll with 1 damage on 1-2 botches and a 2-damage critical wound on 3 or more botches rsulting in a broken limb or concussion. There will be part of the river that sweeps the PCs under, requiring a willpowe check to hold their breath. A roll with 1-2 failures will result in a blackout, leaving the PC unable to navigate, and susceptible to another 1 harm from collisions. A roll with 3 or more botches will result in drowning; a drowned PC will die on the banks of the river in the wasteland unless immediately healed or stabilized. PCs can expend Risk to save each other. Any player that has a PC die can take over Jem or another agent in Portia or at the safe house.

It's also possible that the PCs' splashes and screams attract the attention of a blind horde of orcs living under the moutain who rush into the river and follow the dwarves out into the wasteland and towards dwarven settlements.

***If the PCs decide to defend the crypt,*** they will have to fight through 50 cloaks to escape, assuming the cloaks don't call in reinforcements. Two PCs can fight side-by-side at the entrance of the crypt. Only one at a time can stand a fight in the tunnel leading back to the crypt iself. There is enough room for about 20-30 dwarves inside the crypt chamber. The PCs might problem solve here or use Aarok's bones. Whoever uses all of them at once gets +1 success into willpower rolls against other swarves, and other dwarves take -1 success into willpower rolls against that PC. The PC with the bones will feel a strong compulsion never to give them up and to talk with the bones about their needs. The bones will bias them towards characters with similar wants and needs and against characters with competing desires. If the PCs have to retreat into the chamber itself, the cloaks may collapse the tunnel, trapping them inside and forcing them to look for a way out through the crypt (see above).

***If the PCs decide to scramble down the north face of Mount Cineris towards the dead ring,*** they will all have to roll a combined 10 acrobatics successes against 6. Each botch along the way inflicts 1 damage. Each roll with 2 botches breaks a bone, inflicts 2 damage, and makes the difficulty an 8; each roll with 3 botches inflicts 2 damage, knocks out the PC who rolled it, and they have to be carried by another character whose difficulty goes to 8 if it's not there yet. Then the PCs have to narrate their escape through the dead ring and into the Soma ring to hire a Gigaphid out of there. 

#### The road back home

Intersitials, healing, planning, advancement.

#### Is this house safe?

Gotnafiskr can send *The Weeping Angel* to Portia if the PCs want to go after Stoneshaper Keep or to infiltrate the caravan. They can also send the ship to the safe house outside Visus if the PCs want to restock and research anything before hading to Denokta. There is not enough time to stop Root if the PCs try to go to both places and do both things unless Jem is also sent to delay the caravan.

The ship will have the extra camouflage cloaks, the ancient dwarven forge gauntlets, and Naardor, who is going to pick up Old Embrey and Cantor. Hamner turned mercenary, and Gotnafiskr considers him a traitor, heretic, and apostate. Naardor will tell the PCs that he's taking Embrey and Cantor away from Cineris, maybe over to Sphere, if the PCs are ever in the neighborhood.

If the PCs go to Portia, Fishhook, just hired by Root to find and kills the PCs, will be waiting to fight them at the docks. He'll thank them for making his new job easier.

Apart from that potential confrontation, this is mini-down time. 

### Getting to the root of things

The last part of the session should be spent planning and executing an assault on Root or his interests.

This should be improvised according to PCs plans. Jem may or may not be around to help along with the PCs other assets.

If Jem survives, it might be cool to pay for a shardstorm attack on Stoneshaper Keep while also sending in Jem's raiding cell.

Notes from th "Important NPCs" section of [session-6-spoilers.md](session-6-spoilers.md) sketch out Stoneshaper Keep and scenarios and locations the PCs might encounter in Denokta. Refer to those notes to create the context for improvising what happens next. We are near the end of this part of the campaign. Generally, the PCs can:

- Assault Root and Stoneshaper Keep, directly or indirectly, or infiltrate the latter to confront the former.
- Go to Denokta, evade or fight through Black Mask scouts, pass through the river on level 3, hit the Chamber of Need, and then unlock and raise the City of Aarok (freeing Gotnafiskr) by satisfying the Iron Seneschals in Ruundum's Hall.
- Infiltrate the caravan and "invade" Denokta with Root's forces.

Some things the PCs might find in Stoneshaper Keep:

- The ritual magic instructions and chambers for creating Black Masks.
- Shards smuggled out of Sphere and labeled by location, last owner, and type of network.
- The artificers' workshops and incomplete notes they left behind.
- Prototypes of the synthetic shards and shard eyes.
- Labs for growing synthetic shards.
- The mother red crystal.
- Unassigned red crystals.
- A small armory for the keep's guards.
- Root's treasures (e.g. the jewels, paintings, and artifacts on display).
- The ritualists attempting to raise Aarok.

Beats to hit include:

- Faelin is hard to hide, especially if PCs infiltrate the caravan.
- The caravan is actually just a pair of trade wagons guarded by elite cloaks disguised as merchants. One of the wagons has a false wagon bed that has a shadow chamber door beneath it. It's the cloaks' plan to infitrate the customes district inside Denokta's first floor in the hill and to open the chamber, spilling 200 deranged Black Masks into the city, all of them bent on slaughter.
- One of the Black Masks is Kilvar's sister.
- The Red and Silver Mask are more connected to Root than anyone thought (daughters).
- The Chamber of Need is creepy as hell, but may help Faelin, especially.
- Gotnafiskr is trapped under Denokta until the locks that drain the magma from Ruundum's Hall are released to raise the City of Aarok.
- When freed, Gotnafiskr may snap Root in two if he is in Ruundum's Hall and then spit half his corpse at the Red and Silver Masks' feet. Maybe the PCs can back Root up towards the lava pool; then he can try to dive into it to commit suicide; then Gotnafiskr can get him. Balance the PCs desire to kill Root themselves with how metal it would be for Gotnafiskr to show up like this.
- The City of Aarok is a huge deal. Gotnafiskr's new avatar will emerge from the remains of the lake and exhort the PCs to, "Call the dwarves. Call all the dwarves!"

### Notes from [session-6-spoilers.md](session-6-spoilers.md)

#### Gotnafiskr

Gotnafiskr finishes what Aarok begins and brings Aarok's ideas and prototypes more fully into the world.

Because Gotnafiskr is connected to Aarok and their domain is more concrete than notional, Gotnafisker woke where they were trapped by sleep when knowledge of Aarok, Gotnafiskr, and their cult passed from practice before the invasion and even before the catastrophe.

Whereas Aarok is notional and multifaceted and appears differently as needed, Gotnafiskr embodies completion and the kind of creation that makes a dream real - typically, but not always, singular in form or in one form per era. 

Gotnafiskr will stay in their sea serpent form until the city they helped Ruundum build - Aarok - rises from Black Lake.

The city can rise when the Iron Seneschals in Ruundum's Hall release their locks. These locks will let the magma under Denokta surge into the cone of the Black Lake volcano, raising the city as the lake's water falls downward and coats is structures in a volcanic glass. The city will be a marvel of brutalism with workshops and foundaries and cooling systems that run hot and cold throughut, connecting every building to the others and to a throne atop the highest hill in the symmetrical city on which sits the Iron Seneschal of Aarok himself, now bound to this place to inspire a new age of dwarven craftpersonship.

Gotnafiskr will then become a martial avatar to lead the dwarves against the humans and end the conflict Root and Arok began. They will rise from the lake around the city of Aarok in a gout of water revealing a crytalline-armored merfolk kind of person with gills running up both sides of their face instead of a mouth. Their voice will be like the crashing of waves and the rasp of the rusf together. They will be armed with wateed steel and cyrstal blades. They will stand at 3 meters and impose their will on all dwarves around them.

Binding Aarok in this way will keep Root from summoning and binding him in another.

Gotnafiskr must arrange and inflict calamaties on the dwarves to keep them in a cycle of beginnings or endings, or they must end them, and they can see a day when no more dwarves live on Cineris because of them. They birthed the dwaves in response to Aarok's idea of children who needed his teaching and could create with him and perhaps one day surpass him.

Gotnafiskr can equip the party with camouflage cloaks having had enough time to reverse-engineer Petra's work and build a few more prototypes.

At some point, Gotnafisker will probably also just wipe away the human side of Visus with a wave or something.

Gotnafiskr's goals:

1. Raise the city of Aarok before Root can bind Aarok to something else and thereby reunite with Aarok.
2. Obliterate Root for trying to control Aarok.
3. Retake the homelands.
4. Restore the Black Masks to their dwarven selves.

#### Aarok, the molten dread

Dwarven god of innovation, creativity, and creation, especially at the forge, shaped in each era by the needs of the dwarves that worship him or the will Gotnafiskr imposes on him. Already summoned as a magma Golem in the Sootbeard Mine temple. Perhaps summoned elsewhere. Aarok's bones are interred in a crypt on Mount Cineris that Jem is seaching for to prove herself Aarok's true servant over Root, who has taken shortcuts and taken dwarves' identities from them in his efforts to win back and, ultimately, rule, the homelands. Gotnafiskr wants to bind Aarok into a city.

Aarok's goals:

1. Invent whatever is needed to meet the needs of his children, the dwarves.
2. Reunite with Gotnafiskr.

#### Ruundum

An ancient dwarven king who worked with Gotnafiskr before the last sleeping to create the Chamber of Need, Ruundum's Hall, and the city of Aarok. Ruundum ruled over a time of peace and prosperity below ground and centralized the workship of Aarok and Gotnafiskr. An unknown calamity buried his civilization and others were built on top of it. Maybe orcs. Maybe another dwarven nation worshipping another god. Ruundum can answer questions about this if the PCs ask and create this lore.

Ruundum's goals:

1. Preserve the City of Aarok until it's needed by the dwarves.
2. Begin a new golden age of dwarven craft and culture.

##### The Chamber of Need

The Chamber of Need is a chamber full of crystals of dwarves and other heroes of all types who volunteered or were taken prisoner and forced into the crystals as wraithes of their former selves. A person can stand in front of one of these giant networked crystals, seem themselves inflected as the hero they think they need right now, and swap out part of their essence for part of the essesnce of one of these trapped heroes. That PC has to be played as a diminished version of themselves coupled with the quiet presence of another only they can hear and whose talents and memories they can draw from to meet their needs. The process of taking on new essence involves passing out and suffering a vision of violent transformation or crisis.

**PCs' visions**

These are jarring and intense visions of violence and horror that might go along with a process that remakes a person. You can try them with your playgroup if they fit within PCs' comfort zones, but don't force or insist on delivering these visions as part of the Chamber of Need side plot.

Before sharing these visions, introduce a facilitation tool like "Pause," "Stop", or "X." Tell PCs that any of them can type any of those phrases into the group chat to stop and skip this line (portion of the narrative) or to draw a veil over it (the scene is very vaguely described, and we move on from it). Line and veil are borrowed from Norweign LARPs. Pause, Stop, and X tools are taken from the games Winterhorn and Spire.

- *Faelin:* You are awake and part of a elven ritual. They are butchering a live, awake elf, cutting out pieces of its brain, marrow, and heart, and, to your pain and horror, grafting them into your bound, broken, and spread body. Finish the dream.
- *Wally:* You are in the temple of Aarok and Gotnafiskr, surrounded by skeletons, as Black Masks warp into the space all around you. Every rotting undead face, and every Dissembled face under every mask, is a uniquely corrupted version of Petra. Finish the dream.
- *Kilvar:* You are awake, but paralyzed by Soma consumption; locked in; Elves wearing the bloody heads of freshly slaughtered Gnolls surround you, touch you, and cut runes into your skin until another elf, wearing the decapitated head of a dwarf, begins an incantation that fills you with dread as you scream and lose your mind to terror. Finish the dream.
- *Ob:* You are in a small row boat at sea without paddles during a storm, and the zombie fishmuck version of Fishhook crawls aboard from within the waves. The toss and turn of the waves doesn't affect him, and you feel like you are going to lose. Fishhook starts sprouting oozing, necrotic black tentacles with bone hooks - strung with gore - emerging at the end of each. Finish the dream.
- *Psalt:* Your eyes are closed. You know you are in the shadow realm. You know that keeping your eyes closed is the only way to stay hidden. You can hear voices all around you - legions of them - those you hurt, killed, betrayed, disappointed, left behind - and one, so important to you, calling for help - but you know that if you open your eyes to find them and help them all of the phantoms of your past will descend upon you and drive you to madness. Finish the dream.

##### Ruundum's Hall

A massive hall lit by a huge pool of lava at one end. 4 Iron Seneschals, including Ruundum the King, rise from the floor in a semi circle near the middle of the hall. The walls are covered with gem-tiled mosaics of Ruundum's time and beliefs. Aarok and Gotnafiskr figure prominently in scenes of world creation, battles, and blessing dwarven creations.

The Sensechals are all singing together in ancient dwarven with the hiss and clank of their parts. [Maybe play Lifa by Heilung at this point?]

Ruundum and his fellow Seneschals will not open their locks and release the lava to raise the city of Aarok unless they are convinced of the need.

This is also the setting for an optional scene. If Root and his operatives have made it here, the PCs will find them approaching the Seneschals. A fight will begin. The Red and Silver masks will attack the PCs while Root attempts to summon another magma Golem to fight for him (or perhaps engulf and join with him). Gotnafiskr in their current form will breach the lava and bite Root in two, snapping him in half and spitting his corpse at the masks. Then Gotnafiskr will tell the PCs to meet them at the city of Arrok before diving below the leava (and then fswimming through it as it drains from below Denokta to raise the city under Black Lake). The masks will take off their masks, revealing their Dissembled features, and then grieve and console one another over Root. It will becom clear they are close somehow, if not that they are Root's daughters. They will fight the PCs, masks off, to the death.

**The Seneschals and their questions**

Any proof offered in response to its question will open a Seneschal's lock. Ruundum built this place to fulfill a need, not lock it away.

Goterdrum, king's artificer: How do I know Aarok is awake?

Loda, captain of the stoneguard: How do I know Gotnafiskr is awake?

Baligbak, historian of needs: How do I know that it is a time of ending?

Ruundum, king of dwarves: How do I know that this city is for you?

##### The city of Aarok

A massive, brutal, symmetrical, stone and gold city of dwarven dwellings and workshops built on a hill capped by Aarok, the Seneschal, on a stone throne. Lines of magma and water connect everything, heating forges and tempering creations. This is how Gotnafiskr binds Aarok to Cineris to help her end the human invasion and this is how Gotnafiskr begins the last cycle of beginnings and endings after the restoration that will one day lead to the dwaves leaving Cineris.

#### Root Stoneshaper and his masks

Root may appear if the PCs go to Denokta, along with the Red and Silver masks.

Denokta is the human capital city on Cineris. It is a mix of above- and below-ground levels. Above ground, around a massive, grassy hill, is a human farming and trade settlement. Built into the hill is the gate to the rest of Denokta.

- Level 1 - The grasslands farming and trade settlement.
- Level 0 - Like the I/O between the other underground levels and the grasslands settlement. Occupied by customs/immigration, trade offices and markets, warehouses, cops, soldiers, barracks, and externally-facing government agencies.
- Level -1 - A residential zone for underground workers; the kinds of services and commerce you'd expect in a civilian, residential zone; cops and a few soldiers for support.
- Level -2 - Industry and storehouses for underground goods to be shipped or refined and then shipped up to the markets and warehouses at level 0; more soldiers than cops, barracks; cut in half by a river that makes it easy to shift goods around the district.
- Level -3 - A residential zone for elites; house guards; soldiers, barracks; colleges, guilds, luxury districts.
- Level -4 - A fortress level for the ruling government.
- Levels -5 and beyond - Mines and homes of ancient horrors, Dwarf Fortress style.

Far below level 5, accessible only by the underground river on level 3 (which was created when Ruundum flooded the paths to his hall and became a Seneschal), is the Chamber of Need, Ruundum's Hall, and locks to the city of Aarok.

The PCs may also try to infiltrate Stoneshaper Keep at some point to confront Root. See the map in the GM's notebook for a layout. [I'll add a copy here later.] They should find some labs that suggest what the other artificers were doing, as well as a stockpile of crystals with strange labels indicating they came from Sphere (e.g. Sylvetica; Broswer's cryptoden; guard). Root is collecting these so his Black Masks can Shard Warp to Sphere, organize, and make a decapitation attack against the Risk Eaters and Cryptarchs. This is his long-term plan now, though once he hoped to attack the homelands with conventional forces, drawing out the Risk Eaters to Cineris, so he could surprise those remaining on Sphere with his Black Masks.

Moving through either place, outiftted with gear from Gotnafiskr, should be a battle of stealth and wits.

Root's goals:

1. Summon Aarok and bind him to Root's cause.
2. Free the homelands.
3. Rule the homelands.
4. Drive the dwaves into a new age of technology and manufacturing that will free them of the Risk Eater threat forever.
5. Decapitate the Risk Eaters. 
6. Kill everything in his way.

#### Fishhook

Fishhook is a former frenemy of Ob's from his fishing and mercenary days. He's been hired by Root in Portia to track down Hamner since the PCs have betrayed Root. His next mission will be to kill the PCs.

- HP 12
- MP 4
- C 4d10 + 1d6
- M 1d10 + 4d6
- To hit 8
- D/P 4d10 + 1d6
- Hook hand +1 damage
- Spells
  - Messenger
  - Tracer
  - Astral eyes
  
Fishhook's goals:

1. Make money killing things.
2. Kill Ob in a gross way to prove who is the grossest.

## Outcomes & rewards

Aarok's Bones. The Bloody Warden. Loot from any cloaks killed on Mount Cineris. Gotnafiskr's gifts on *The Weeping Angel*. Loot from Black Masks and dead humans in Denokta. Loot from Root and his Red and Silver Masks. Loot from the City of Aarok. Boons from the Chamber of Need.

**Aarok's Bones**

  - Macbre: these blackened, cracked bones are oozing sooty, smoky-smelling marrow and other gunk as Aarok tries to find a corporeal form in response to Root's ritual magic and needs. If the PCs were to find a necromancer to reform the skeleton correctly, it might come to life and become an avatar bound to Root's needs at this point since the City of Aarok isn't raised and no one is casting ritual magic against Root's cultists.

- Great powers

  - The presence of any PC carrying Aarok's bones intimidates other dwarves around them and makes other dwarves ignore a success on any roll made aganst the PC carrying the bones.
  - The PC carrying the bones adds a success to any Charm, Deception, Menace, or Performance roll made against other dwarves.
  - A splinter sect of the cult of Aarok and Gotnafiskr now serves the PC who holds the bones. They are code clerics specializing in reading, translating, and decrypting ancient texts on Cineris.

- Great costs

  - The PC is compelled to follow Aarok and Gotnafiskr and must align decisions with their needs or else make a tough Will power check to act indepdendently.
  - Aarok and Gotnafiskr - and other dwaven gods - are aware of the PC's whereabouts and general condition at all times.
  - The PC is bound to the bones and becomes irrationally unwilling to give them up to anyone but Aarok or Gotnafiskr; they must fight to the death to keep and protect the bones.

If Jem becomes an agent of the PCs, she will warn them before they touch the bones that whoever carries them has to keep them until they can be surrendered to Aarok's new avatar. She will also say they have great power and that dwarves fear whoever carries them unless they follow that person and, by extension, Aarok. She will ask for her sword back and for the bones and express a desire to infiltrate the caravan, subvert as many Black Masks and conventional Magmatic personnel as possible, and deliver them into the PCs service as a cel.
