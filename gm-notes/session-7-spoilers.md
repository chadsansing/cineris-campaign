### Important NPCs

#### Jem Brighthelm

Jem is a fighter, weapons designer, and former Magmatic artificer. She was part of Root's Aarok cult, but became both jealous of Root and upset with his obsession with technology, his willingness to sacrice dwarves' identities to create the Black Masks, and his plan to take on the Risk Eaters and humans at once. She has more intelligence on Root's plan than anyone not still inside Magmatic. She knows Root wanted to attack the humans with conventional forces and then strike the Risk Eaters on Sphere through smuggled shards. She has heard someone is messing with Root's plans and that he has had to change them, but she has been gone long enough so that she doesn't know what his current plans are.

Jem wants to:

- Raise Aarok.
- Prove herself worthy to be Aarok's chief priest and lieutenant over Root.
- Kill Root, if necessary.
- Follow Aarok to drive out the humans.

Jem is climbing Mount Cineris with her personal guard to find the crypt of Aarok's last sleeping, which should hold the bones of his last dwarven avatar.

If defeated and spared or given the chance to negotiate, Jem will follow the PCs if they convince her that they serve Aarok or Aarok and Gotnafiskr; she would rather die following a leader to drive out the humans than needlessly in an unimportant battle. If she is defeated and spared or if the PCs reach a deal with her, Jem can become:

- An NPC general of conventional dwarven forces she can raise apart from the general population and anti-Root sympathizers at Magmatic. She can raise a few hundred regular or irregular troops from her clan, the general populace, and Magmatic executives, employees, and guards.
- An NPC general of the Black Masks if Gotnafiskr and the PCs can free them fom Root's influence (raising the City of Aarok will be enough to sway most dwarves, even conditioned ones, to Gotnafiskr and the PCs). There are approximately 100 Black Masks.
- A cel capable of successful raids on trivial and challenging targets and capable of successful sucide missions on tough targets. Combinging Jem with another cel on a suicide mission will reduce its difficulty from tough to to challenging.
- A playable PC if one of the other PCs (cough, cough, Faelin) dies or leaves during this session.

Jem has the prototype steel and red crystal sword known as the Bloody Warden. It absorbs the soul name of its last victim; its weilder can then attempt to decrypt anything they read that's been encrypted with the victim's true name. It's a +2 damage, overwhelming, macabre claymore that glows red and seems to have the outline of its last victim dsparately trying to climb out of the blade if you look at it with Astral Eyes.

#### Tomb golem

This is a cryptogear tomb that looks like a sarcophagus and comes to life to fight anyone trying to open it. As a last resort, it will cast Maze on itself (difficulty 4) to hide its seams.

The tomb golem Jem Brightblade wants to open is said to hold the bones of Aarok, the Molten Dread.

The golem can be deactivated by voice command if someone knows the true name of the tomb's contents. The golem will filter that commend through the remains of the deceased to decrypt embedded instructions to stand down and open itself.

You have to hit this Golem with 2 or more successes to do damage because of its damage reduction; it also has light deflection, so anytime a PC hits with 1 success, damage is ignored.

## Story

### Background

After surviving a Risk Eater attack and interviewing Dril - or Gotnafiskr - last session, the PCs have decided to track down one more artificer before confronting Root. Root, in the meantime, has sped up his timetable and changed his plans; he is rallying his Black Masks from their sleeper cels in Stranger communities to travel west by caravan in hopes of setting up a decaptitation strike on the human government and military in Denokta, capital of the occupied homelands.

The PCs understand some of the relationshop between Aarok and Gotnafiskr and why Gotnafiskr wants Root killed - for trying to bind Aarok to his will, for perverting dwarven identity with the Black Masks, and for ignoring Gotnafiskr's place in the mythology they share with Aarok. Gotnafiskr's ultimate aim is to drive out the humans, as well, because that is the task Root summoned Aarok to begin.

Faelin is in a weird place.

The PCs are pursuing Jem Brighthelm because she is trying to recover the bones of Aarok's last dwarven avatar from their resting place on Mt. Cineris, the crypt of Aarok's last sleeping.

Once the PCs complete their encounter with Jem, they will have to decide how to confront Root. They can attempt to kill him at Stoneshaper Keep before the caravan leaves with the help of a shardstormer cel, or they can attempt to outrace Root to Denokta and look for Gotnafiskr's sign to know that Gotnafiskr is real.

### Scenes

#### Preparing for adventure

If the PCs haven't detailed their advancement in the repo, they should take time at the beginning of the session for character advancement, buying Strategic Assets, and preparing for their putsuit of Jem. This will be the last time Naardor can help them before he attempts to disappear.

PCs should remember the gifts Naardor gave them.

- Shard arrows - a crystal shard with 11 arrowheads in its network that can be used to tag and track objects or prey.
- Gotnafiskr's Tooth - dagger +1 damage; must draw blood whenever drawn or it will stick in its sheath forever; wielder's hand seeps blood painlessly when holding it.
- Gilded echo eater in a crystal jar; break jar in case of emergency network.
- A bottle of Vimdrought.
- Walking workshop.
- Cryptomancer's kit.

PCs should also improvise a way to wield Aarok's Sword.

Gotnafiskr will also send *The Weeping Angel* to deliver 1d4 camouflage cloaks. They add 1 success to Stealth rolls and ignore 1 botch. 

**Camouflage cloak**

- +1 success on Stealth rolls
- Ignore 1 botch on Stealth rolls

#### Tracking Jem

The PCs can travel to the base of Mount Cineris using Kilvar's Pass; Naardor can get them horses. They can pass the time with Interstitials.

Successful tracking rolls will find evidences of camp fires and small supply caches (food we don't need to drag up the mountain) for a return trip along a roughly 2-day ascent.

Roll for Risk and Magmatic Risk.

On the second day of the climb, near the Crypt of Aarok's last sleeping, the PCs will be ambushed by Jem's guard. She's left them behind to watch her back.

The guard includes 3 combat cloaks and 1 magic cloak. The magic cloak will stay back under cover, as will 1 combat cloak with a crossbow. The 2 combat cloaks with sword & dagger will engage the PCs.

#### The crypt of Aarok's last sleeping

This is where the PCs will confront Jem.

They may kill her, defeat and spare her, or negotiate with her. Outcomes for sparing her or negotiating with her are detailed above under Props --> Important PCs --> Jem Brighthelm.

Whenever Jem or the PCs attempt to open the crypt, the Tomb Golem will activate and attack.

The keyword "Gotnafiskr" will undo the effects of Maze on the tomb if the Golem casts it while dying.

Inside the tomb are Aarok's Bones, a relic.

**Aarok's Bones**

  - Macbre: these blackened, cracked bones are oozing sooty, smoky-smelling marrow and other gunk as Aarok tries to find a corporeal form in response to Root's ritual magic and needs. If the PCs were to find a necromancer to reform the skeleton correctly, it might come to life and become an avatar bound to Root's needs at this point since the City of Aarok isn't raised and no one is casting ritual magic against Root's cultists.

- Great powers

  - The presence of any PC carrying Aarok's bones intimidates other dwarves around them and makes other dwarves ignore a success on any roll made aganst the PC carrying the bones.
  - The PC carrying the bones adds a success to any Charm, Deception, Menace, or Performance roll made against other dwarves.
  - A splinter sect of the cult of Aarok and Gotnafiskr now serves the PC who holds the bones. They are code clerics specializing in reading, translating, and decrupting ancient texts on Cineris.

- Great costs

  - The PC is compelled to follow Aarok and Gotnafiskr and must align decisions with their needs or else make a tough Will power check to act indepdendently.
  - Aarok and Gotnafiskr - and other dwaven gods - are aware of the PC's whereabouts and general condition at all times.
  - The PC is bound to the bones and becomes irrationally unwilling to give them up to anyone but Aarok or Gotnafiskr; they must fight to the death to keep and protect the bones.

#### Going after Root

The last part of the session should be spent planning for an assault on Root or his interests.

This should be improvised according to PCs plans. Jem may or may not b around to help along with the PCs other assets.

If PCs want to get home quickly or to Portia or Denokta via Gigaphids hired from the elves, they can go down the challening face of Mount Cineris. They need 10 acrobatics or athletics successes to make the descent that way. On any roll with 3 or more botches, a PC takes a critical wound - like a broken bone, and has to be stabilized somehow before contuining or else slow the group down by another day per wounded PC. Otherwise, they can backtrack and travel by horse, but it will take a few days instead of 1.

If Jem survives, it might be cool to pay for a shardstorm attack on Stoneshaper Keep while also sending in Jem's raiding cel.

Notes from [session-6-spoilers.md](session-6-spoilers.md) sketch out Stoneshaper Keep and scenarios and locations the PCs might encounter in Denokta. Refer to those notes to create the context for improvising what happens next. We are near the end of this part of the campaign. Generally, the PCs can:

- Assault Root and Stoneshaper Keep, directly or indirectly, or infiltrate the latter to confront the former.
- Go to Denokta, evade or fight through Black Mask scouts, pass through the river on level 3, hit the Chamber of Need, and then unlock and raise the City of Aarok (freeing Gotnafiskr) by satisfying the Iron Seneschals in Ruundum's Hall.
- Infiltrate the caravan and "invade" Denokta with Root's forces.

Some things the PCs might find in Stoneshaper Keep:

- The ritual magic instructions and chambers for creating Black Masks.
- Shards smuggled out of Sphere and labeled by location, last owner, and type of network.
- The artificers' workshops and incomplete notes they left behind.
- Prototypes of the synthetic shards and shard eyes.
- Labs for growing synthetic shards.
- The mother red crystal.
- Unassigned red crystals.
- A small armory for the keep's guards.
- Root's treasures (e.g. the jewels, paintings, and artifacts on display).
- The ritualists attempting to raise Aarok.

Beats to hit include:

- Faelin is hard to hide, especially if PCs infiltrate the caravan.
- A Black Mask is Kilvar's sister.
- The Red and Silver Mask are more connected to Root than anyone thought (daughters).
- The Chamber of Need is creepy as hell, but may help Faelin, especially.
- Gotnafiskr is trapped under Denokta until the locks that drain the magma from Ruundum's Hall are released to raise the City of Aarok.
- When freed, Gotnafiskr may snap Root in two if he is in Ruundum's Hall and then spit half his corpse at the Red and Silver Masks' feet. Maybe the PCs can back Root up towards the lava pool; then he can try to dive into it to commit suicide; then Gotnafiskr can get him. Balance the PCs desire to kill Root themselves with how metal it would be for Gotnafiskr to show up like this.
- The City of Aarok is a huge deal. Gotnafiskr's new avatar will emerge from the remains of the lake and exhort the PCs to, "Call the dwarves. Call all the dwarves!"

## Outcomes & rewards

If Jem survives, the PCs can recruit her as a Strategic Asset for raids or make her an NPC general of regular or irregular forces.

Jem will want to keep Bloody Warden if the PCs negotiate with her, but if she is defeated and spared, she will surrender it to Kilvar.

PCs can keep Aarok's Bones or give them to Jem to help her recruit regular or irregular forces.

PCs will also get +1 TP for surviving and +1 TP by player per hack.

The group will get +1 SA in addition to Jem, if she survives.

The PCs may find additonal loot in caches, on enemies corpses, or in Denokta or the City of Aarok.
