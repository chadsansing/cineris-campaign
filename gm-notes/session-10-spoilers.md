## Props

### Important NPCs

#### Jem Brighthelm

Jem is a fighter, weapons designer, and former Magmatic artificer. She is also a true believer in Aarok and Gotnafiskr and the current keeper of Aarok's Bones.

She is raising a force of irreuglars to prevent Root from carrying out his plans in Denokta. She wants to kill Root and serve as Aarok's chief lieutenant in the war to reclaim the dwarven homelands.

Right now Jem and 17 irregulars recruited from around Portia and Magmatic are waiting for further orders from the PC after the battle on the road to Visus.

See also: past session notes.

#### Aarok & Gotnafiskr

See also: past session notes. Gotnafiskr is impatient for the group to make it to Denokta to confront Root.

#### Root Stoneshaper

See also: past session notes. Root is *en route* to Denokta to launch his decapitation attack on the human government before the PCs can interfere further.

His ritual magic division is working over time to summon an avatar of Aarok that will help Root; this magic is weakening the power of Aarok's Bones, which ar currently held by Jem Brighthelm. PCs wielding the bones may ignore a botch or take an extra success, but not both, this session, and the bones influence on their wielder - its asking what they need and changing them into a sootier version of themselves - is not as powerful this session.

## Story

### Background

With the help of Jem's irregulars, the group has stopped the small caravan, but at great cost, with multiple party membes taking critical and mortal wounds. These wounds required them to greatly diminish their supply of healing potions and to incur risk to avoid death.

Jem has 17 irregulars, down from 24 before the battle.

The PCs have 12 unopened chests and 4 crates of Magmatic Black Oath shard crystals to deal with.

Gotnafiskr also wants to intervene in Visus so the party can pass through the city and get to Denokta quickly. They will ask the PCs which party to destory - the human side of the city or the Magmatic amphibious dwarven force coming down the river.

### Scenes

#### The wreck of the small caravan

The group needs to decide what to do with the locked chests and the black shard crystals.

#### The fate of Visus

The group needs to tell Gotnafiskr how to deal with Visus - she wants them through the city as quickly as possible and on to Denokta. She will drown the dwarves coming down-river or the human side of the city and encourage the party to make its way through the sewers, across the river, and back through the sewers to get to their safe house before immediately setting out again, which the group may or may not agree to given their wounds.

The group will arrive at Visus in time to see the aftermath of their decision. Roll risk.

#### A night at home

The party can spare a night if they want Root to make it to Denokta first for sure. They might spend experience or research or just rest and recover.

This will upset Gotnafiskr, especially if the party had them drown the dwarves at Visus. Gotnafiskr may be leaning towards Jem and away from the group.

Interstitials can happen here.

#### Denokta or bust

Still hoping the PCs will make it to Denokta, find the circular river on level 3, follow it, and crash into the Chamber of Need.

Interstitials can happen on the way if they haven't yet. The party can make it through the border fort with a bribe from the locked chests if they think of it.

#### Downstream

This is a placeholder session for the PCs' experiences in the chamber of need, Ruundum's Hall, and City of Aarok, all described in past sessions. We'll get as far as we can!

### Past notes on Denokta

See also: past session notes

Root's part of the end game happens in Denokta. Scenarios are described in past sessions. Here is an outline of what might happen.

- Travel through the homelands and the slums and camp cities outside Denokta. Little military.
- Arrive at level 0; pay a toll; enter the city. Some military.
- Enter level -1, the first underground district full of low-income housing and support services. Some military.
- Descend to level -2, the warehouse district. An underground river rings this district. It is Gotnafiskr's sign. It enters through a waterfall and leaves down another. The PCs can jump down that waterfall and risk a critical or mortal wound to reach the Chamber of Need. Heavy military.
- Level -3 is where the Black Mask assault will begin. This is the government and elites disctrict with the offices, services, parks, shaopping, and other luxuries one would expect. Heavy military. This is a good place for Kilvar to find his sister, one of the Black Masks, who tries to communicate by playing an old childhood game with him, Crows Bones.
- Level -4 is a crystal mining level. Heavy military.
- Level -5 is a crystal mining level. Heavy military.
- The humans haven't made it any further yet. A mix of riches and Dwarf Fortress horror awaits them below.
- The Chamber of Need would be the equivalent of level -9 or so.
- Ruundum's Hall would be the equivalent of level -10 or so.

Roots plan should go off around the PCs so Kilvar can have his moment with his sister.

The Chamber of Need gives PCs the chance to reinvent themselves by exchanging part of their soul for part of a hero's soul trapped in one of the chamber's giant crystals. King Runduum, a worshipper and servant of Aarok and Gotnafiskr, collected parts of the souls of his followers and prisoners in case dwarves needed them in the future. 

The GM asks each PC to describe who they see in the crystal when they think of what they need the most right now. The PCs invent names and histories for their visions. Then they can reach out to the visions or not. If they do, the enter a process of becoming both heroes at once while some of their soul goes into the crystal to make room for what they take.

Nightmares accompany this process. PCs have to opt in to this functional re-spec; a nightmare has been written for each in past session notes. Some feature horror that should be facilitated with care and with X/line/veil tools in PCs' hands to end or skip the scenes.

Runduum's Hall is where Runduum and 3 other iron seneschals (masterwork oracles) await the PCs to unlock the pipes that will send magma under Black Lake, causing the deep waters to become steam and raise the City of Aarok in a moment of dwarves' need. When the pipes are unlocked, Gotnafiskr is also frred to swim to Black Lake and emerge in her martial form.

This hall has a pool of magma on one side against which the PCs will find Root and the Red Mask and Silver Mask attempting to summon Aarok from the magma.

The PCs can kill Root, or Gotnafiskr can breach the magma and snap him in 2 pieces that land at his daughters' feet (the Red and Silver Masks). They will mourn in a way that implies some kind of connection bewteen them and Root, and then turn on the PCs to commit suicide by combat.

If the PCs have time to go to Black Lake after resolving Denokta (do the humans evacuate? Do Jem's irregulars work with the Black Masks to slaughter them?) they will witness Gotnafiskr's martial form rising from the lake and see the City of Aarok rise, as well.

This part of the campaign should end with some rewards for the PCs. Maybe treasure. Maybe serving in the city. Maybe being made into a seneschal. 

The next part of the campaign will deal with the Risk Eaters plans for Cineris, what it's like to live during an age of Aarok and Gotnafiskr, the attack on the human invaders, and what kind of future there is on Cineris if the dwarves win.

## Outcomes & rewards

Loot from slain allies and enemies; the shard crystals and treasure from the small caravan; loot from Denokta.

## Insterstitials (between-the-scenes)

- *"I once saw a wave like that," or, "I wonder what other powers Gotnafiskr hasn't shared with us yet."*
- *"Those gems give me the shivers," or, "What do we do about Magmatic after this?"*
- *"Why haven't the Risk Eaters just ended Root?", or, "Are we putting ourselves in even more danger by killing Root?"*
- *"What do you think Gotnafiskr's sign will be?", or, "Where do you think Gotnafiskr really is?"*
- *"I worry about what will happen to us if Gotnafiskr thinks Jem is a more useful tool," or, "What do we do if Root summons Aarok and the bones stop working?"*
- *"So, does Jem get to keep the bones forever?", or, "I kind of want a turn with those bones."*
- *"Ob, you've never been so close to death. Describe how it felt, and then ask Kilvar how it was for him."*
- *"Wally, you were impressed with Psalt's heroics in the battle on the road to Visus; tell him about an ancient dwarven hero he reminded you of and ask him what inspired him to fight so fiercely."*
- *"Faelin, you'be often discerned what will happen next before anyone else in the group has. Tell anyone you'd like what you think you'll find in Denokta, and then ask them what they think will happen to the group."*
- *"Psalt, you've faceed Magmatic Cloaks, Risk Eaters, elemental avatars, tasty morsels, and the undead during your adventure. Tell someone in the group what you've learned and how you think it might help your fight Root. Then ask them what they've learned."*
