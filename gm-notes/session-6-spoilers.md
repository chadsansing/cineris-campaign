### Important NPCs

#### Dril, scales in darkeness

This is probably the session where PCs figure out that Dril is Gotnafiskr.

The PCs can make rolls to ask questions or invent lore in addition to the notes in other sessions and below.

More lore:

Gotnafiskr finishes what Aarok begins and brings Aarok's ideas and prototypes more fully into the world.

Because Gotnafiskr is connected to Aarok and their domain is more concrete than notional, Gotnafisker woke where they were trapped by sleep when knowledge of Aarok, Gotnafiskr, and their cult passed from practice before the invasion and even before the catastrophe.

Whereas Aarok is notional and multifaceted and appears differently as needed, Gotnafiskr embodies completion and the kind of creation that makes a dream real - typically, but not always, singular in form or in one form per era. 

Gotnafiskr will stay in their sea serpent form until the city they helped Ruundum build - Aarok - rises from Black Lake.

The city can rise when the Iron Seneschals in Ruundum's Hall release their locks. These locks will let the magma under Denokta surge into the cone of the Black Lake volcano, raising the city as the lake's water falls downward and coats is structures in a volcanic glass. The city will be a marvel of brutalism with workshops and foundaries and cooling systems that run hot and cold throughut, connecting every building to the others and to a throne atop the highest hill in the symmetrical city on which sits the Iron Seneschal of Aarok himself, now bound to this place to inspire a new age of dwarven craftpersonship.

Gotnafiskr will then become a martial avatar to lead the dwarves against the humans and end the conflict Root and Arok began. They will rise from the lake around the city of Aarok in a gout of water revealing a crytalline-armored merfolk kind of person with gills running up both sides of their face instead of a mouth. Their voice will be like the crashing of waves and the rasp of the rusf together. They will be armed with wateed steel and cyrstal blades. They will stand at 3 meters and impose their will on all dwarves around them.

Binding Aarok in this way will keep Root from summoning and binding him in another.

Gotnafiskr must arrange and inflict calamaties on the dwarves to keep them in a cycle of beginnings or endings, or they must end them, and they can see a day when no more dwarves live on Cineris because of them. They birthed the dwaves in response to Aarok's idea of children who needed his teaching and could create with him and perhaps one day surpass him.

Gotnafiskr can equip the party with camouflage cloaks having had enough time to reverse-engineer Petra's work and build a few more prototypes.

At some point, Gotnafisker will probably also just wipe away the human side of Visus with a wave or something.

Gotnafiskr's goals:

1. Raise the city of Aarok before Root can bind Aarok to something else and thereby reunite with Aarok.
2. Obliterate Root for trying to control Aarok.
3. Retake the homelands.
4. Restore the Black Masks to their dwarven selves.

#### Aarok, the molten dread

Dwarven god of innovation, creativity, and creation, especially at the forge, shaped in each era by the needs of the dwarves that worship him or the will Gotnafiskr imposes on him. Already summoned as a magma Golem in the Sootbeard Mine temple. Perhaps summoned elsewhere. Aarok's bones are interred in a crypt on Mount Cineris that Jem is seaching for to prove herself Aarok's true servant over Root, who has taken shortcuts and taken dwarves' identities from them in his efforts to win back and, ultimately, rule, the homelands. Gotnafiskr wants to bind Aarok into a city.

Aarok's goals:

1. Invent whatever is needed to meet the needs of his children, the dwarves.
2. Reunite with Gotnafiskr.

#### Ruundum

An ancient dwarven king who worked with Gotnafiskr before the last sleeping to create the Chamber of Need, Ruundum's Hall, and the city of Aarok. Ruundum ruled over a time of peace and prosperity below ground and centralized the workship of Aarok and Gotnafiskr. An unknown calamity buried his civilization and others were built on top of it. Maybe orcs. Maybe another dwarven nation worshipping another god. Ruundum can answer questions about this if the PCs ask and create this lore.

##### The Chamber of Need

The Chamber of Need is a chamber full of crystals of dwarves and other heroes of all types who volunteered or were taken prisoner and forced into the crystals as wraithes of their former selves. A person can stand in front of one of these giant networked crystals, seem themselves inflected as the hero they think they need right now, and swap out part of their essence for part of the essesnce of one of these trapped heroes. That PC has to be played as a diminished version of themselves coupled with the quiet presence of another only they can hear and whose talents and memories they can draw from to meet their needs. The process of taking on new essence involves passing out and suffering a vision of violent transformation or crisis.

**PCs' visions**

These are jarring and intense visions of violence and horror that might go along with a process that remakes a person. You can try them with your playgroup if they fit within PCs' comfort zones, but don't force or insist on delivering these visions as part of the Chamber of Need side plot.

Before sharing these visions, introduce a facilitation tool like "Pause," "Stop", or "X." Tell PCs that any of them can type any of those phrases into the group chat to stop and skip this line (portion of the narrative) or to draw a veil over it (the scene is very vaguely described, and we move on from it). Line and veil are borrowed from Norweign LARPs. Pause, Stop, and X tools are taken from the games Winterhorn and Spire.

- *Faelin:* You are awake and part of a elven ritual. They are butchering a live, awake elf, cutting out pieces of its brain, marrow, and heart, and, to your pain and horror, grafting them into your bound, broken, and spread body. Finish the dream.
- *Wally:* You are in the temple of Aarok and Gotnafiskr, surrounded by skeletons, as Black Masks warp into the space all around you. Every rotting undead face, and every Dissembled face under every mask, is a unique and corrupted version of Petra. Finish the dream.
- *Kilvar:* You are awake, but paralyzed by Soma consumption; locked in; Elves wearing the bloody heads of freshly slaughtered Gnolls surround you, touch you, and cut runes into your skin until another elf, wearing the decapitated head of a dwarf, begins an incantation that fills you with dread as you scream and lose your mind to terror. Finish the dream.
- *Ob:* You are in a small row boat at sea without paddles during a storm, and the zombie fishmuck version of Fishhook crawls aboard from within the waves. The toss and turn of the waves doesn't affect him, and you feel like you are going to lose. Finish the dream.
- *Psalt:* Your eyes are closed. You know you are in the shadow realm. You know that keeping your eyes closed is the only way to stay hidden. You can hear voices all around you - legions of them - those you hurt, killed, betrayed, disappointed, left behind - and one, so important to you, calling for help - but you know that to listen further and look for one will let all of them find you and descend upon you. Finish the dream.

##### Ruundum's Hall

A massive hall lit by a huge pool of lava at one end. 4 Iron Seneschals, including Ruundum the King, rise from the floor in a semi circle near the middle of the hall. The walls are covered with gem-tiled mosaics of Ruundum's time and beliefs. Aarok and Gotnafiskr figure prominently in scenes of world creation, battles, and blessing dwarven creations.

The Sensechals are all singing together in ancient dwarven with the hiss and clank of their parts. [Maybe play Lifa by Heilung at this point?]

Ruundum and his fellow Seneschals will not open their locks and release the lava to raise the city of Aarok unless they are convinced of the need.

This is also the setting for an optional scene. If Root and his operatives have made it here, the PCs will find them approaching the Seneschals. A fight will begin. The Red and Silver masks will attack the PCs while Root attempts to summon another magma Golem to fight for him (or perhaps engulf and join with him). Gotnafiskr in their current form will breach the lava and bite Root in two, snapping him in half and spitting his corpse at the masks. Then Gotnafiskr will tell the PCs to meet them at the city of Arrok before diving below the lava (and then fswimming through it as it drains from below Denokta to raise the city under Black Lake). The masks will take off their masks, revealing their Dissembled features, and then grieve and console one another over Root. It will becom clear they are close somehow, if not that they are Root's daughters. They will fight the PCs, masks off, to the death.

**The Seneschals and their questions**

Any proof offered in response to its question will open a Seneschal's lock. Ruundum built this place to fulfill a need, not lock it away.

Goterdrum, king's artificer: How do I know Aarok is awake?

Loda, captain of the stoneguard: How do I know Gotnafiskr is awake?

Baligbak, historian of needs: How do I know that it is a time of ending?

Ruundum, king of dwarves: How do I know that this city is for you?

##### The city of Aarok

A massive, brutal, symmetrical, stone and gold city of dwarven dwellings and workshops built on a hill capped by Aarok, the Seneschal, on a stone throne. Lines of magma and water connect everything, heating forges and tempering creations. This is how Gotnafiskr binds Aarok to Cineris to help her end the human invasion and this is how Gotnafiskr begins the last cycle of beginnings and endings after the restoration that will one day lead to the dwaves leaving Cineris.

#### Root Stoneshaper and his masks

Root may appear if the PCs go to Denokta, along with the Red and Silver masks.

Denokta is the human capital city on Cineris. It is a mix of above- and below-ground levels. Above ground, around a massive, grassy hill, is a human farming and trade settlement. Built into the hill is the gate to the rest of Denokta.

- Level 1 - The grasslands farming and trade settlement.
- Level 0 - Like the I/O between the other underground levels and the grasslands settlement. Occupied by customs/immigration, trade offices and markets, warehouses, cops, soldiers, barracks, and externally-facing government agencies.
- Level -1 - A residential zone for underground workers; the kinds of services and commerce you'd expect in a civilian, residential zone; cops and a few soldiers for support.
- Level -2 - Industry and storehouses for underground goods to be shipped or refined and then shipped up to the markets and warehouses at level 0; more soldiers than cops, barracks; cut in half by a river that makes it easy to shift goods around the district.
- Level -3 - A residential zone for elites; house guards; soldiers, barracks; colleges, guilds, luxury districts.
- Level -4 - A fortress level for the ruling government.
- Levels -5 and beyond - Mines and homes of ancient horrors, Dwarf Fortress style.

Far below level 5, accessible only by the underground river on level 3 (which was created when Ruundum flooded the paths to his hall and became a Seneschal), is the Chamber of Need, Ruundum's Hall, and locks to the city of Aarok.

The PCs may also try to infiltrate Stoneshaper Keep at some point to confront Root. See the map in the GM's notebook for a layout. [I'll add a copy here later.] They should find some labs that suggest what the other artificers were doing, as well as a stockpile of crystals with strange labels indicating they came from Sphere (e.g. Sylvettica; Brower's cryptoden; guard). Root is collecting these so his Black Masks can Shard Warp to Sphere, organize, and make a decapitation attack against the Risk Eaters and Cryptarchs. This is his long-term plan now, though once he hoped to attack the homelands with conventional forces, drawing out the Risk Eaters to Cineris, so he could surprise those remaining on Sphere with his Black Masks.

Moving through either place, outiftted with gear from Gotnafiskr, should be a battle of stealth and wits.

Root's goals:

1. Summon Aarok and bind him to Root's cause.
2. Free the homelands.
3. Rule the homelands.
4. Drive the dwaves into a new age of technology and manufacturing that will free them of the Risk eater threat forever.
5. Kill everything in his way.

#### Fishhook

## Story

### Background

This session should set up the end game of the first part of the campaign.

PCs can go after Root at Stoneshaper Keep, track down 1 more artifcer before Root makes a move, or race Root to Denokta.

Root understands that the PCs and maybe Naardor have betrayed him and has sped up his timetable, shevling some goals to move more quickly through his milestones.

Root now wants to summon the Black Masks he has - which number in the low hundreds - and send them into Denokta with camouflage cloaks to assisinate the human government and elites. He needs to capture Hamner and speed up synthetic crystal production to do this. He has hired Fishhook to capture Hamner.

Dril will have intelligence that Root is speeding up, Magmatic agents have been seen in Stranger communities outside the Soma Ring, Portia, and Visus, and that he seems to be prepping a upply train that could support dozens, if not hundred, of operatives.

It's possible that the PCs also let Root succeed or partially succeed. Dril mostly wants Aarok freed of Root's influence and to crush the humans themselves after that to finish this era.

If the PCs do not go after an artificer, Fishhook will get Hamner, Jem will return to challenge Root (maybe in Denokta) with Aarok's bones, and Cantor will just make a clean getaway. If the PCs go after one of the artificers, the others will end up like this, as well.

### Scenes

#### Resolving downtime

If the PCs haven't been active in the repo, now is the time for research and spending Talent Points and Strategic Assets from Naardor/Visus. They can also have their Magmatic cel do something. The PCs can rool for questions and answers or to invent lore.

#### Setting priorities

This is time set aside for contacting and confronting Dril about Gotnafiskr and what's really going on; the PCs can roll for questions and answers or to invent lore.

If PCs would prefer it, they can do this step and then take downtime to spend their resources with more information at their disposal.

#### Taking the next step

This is time to improvise the PCs' chosen adventure. Are they going after an artificer? Root? Denokta?

The artifcer's scenarios are described in [session-2-spoilers.md](session-2-spoilers.md). There's a map of Stoneshaper Keep in the GM's notebook [which I will add here later] and a flow-chart .

#### Ambush!

We need a fight this session. Make multiple Magmatic and Risk Eater rolls. Magmatic will send Black Masks. The PCs may also fight the Red Mask and Silver Mask below Denokta if things work out that way. The PCs can also fight Fishhook over Hamner if they choose to pursue that artificer.

#### Rewards

Take the last part of the session to distribute any experience and loot the PCs earn.

## Outcomes & rewards

This part of the campaign probably won't end with this session, though it could with Root's death or the raising of the City of Aarok.

Rewards might include artifacts from Ruundum's Hall, loot from enemies, or treasures in the city of Aarok.

PCs whould also get:

- 1 TP for suriving and 1 TP per hack per player.
- 1 SA

If this part of the campaign ends, give PCs an attrbiute rank, as well.

## Insterstitials (between-the-scenes)

- *"I bet all of those other stories my parents told me were true," or "What are the chances we have to kill Aarok again?"*
- *"There's really very little difference between a dragon and sea serpent," or, "How many forms do these gods take?"*
- *"Here's the most amazing thing I read in our library," or, "Here's the best lead I found on the Shard Scape for our next adventure."*
- *"Do you ever think a god like that and a dwarf like me," or, "How does that even work when one is a sea serpent and the other one's a city?"*
- *"I'm thinking of changing jobs," or, "When we get the homelands back, I wonder what I'll be."*
- *"Faelin, what do you think of all this?", or, "Faelin, I'm letting you know right now."*
- *"What do we do with Magmatic after this?", or, "We could probably open our own business after this."*
- *"How many safe houses do you think we can ruin?", or, "I have some ideas for our safe house"*
- *"Why don't we move into the temple," or, "Why don't we set up shop below Denokta?"*
- *"I'm ready to take our fate into our own hands," or, "I'm not risking myself for Aarok, Gotnafiskr, Root, or anyone else."*
