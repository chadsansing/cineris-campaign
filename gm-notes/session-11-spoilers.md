## Story

### Background

The party has made it to Denokta and discovered Gotnafiskr's sign just as Root launches his Black Mask attack.

This is where it all goes down.

### Scenes

The PCs may:

- Die fighting Black Masks and Risk Eaters on the third level of Denokta.
- Die fighting Gotnafiskr in Runduum's Hall.
- Die fighting Root in Runduum's Hall.
- Defeat Root in Runduum's Hall and raise the City of Aarok.
- Join Root and defeat Gotnafiskr in Runduum's Hall after unlocking the seneschals and raising the City of Aarok.
- Join Root and defeat Gotnafiskr in Runduum's Hall without unlocking the seneschals, allowing Root to summon an avatar of Aarok to clear the city.

#### Reckoning in Denokta

The PCs need to decide to go down the ramp or follow the river.

***If the party goes down the ramp after Kilvar,*** they will find the elite district of the human occupation of Denokta in comolete disarray as Black Masks shard warp in above their marks and assassinate everyone who bought a Magmatic Black Oath crystal or took one as a bribe. Jem and her remaining 12 irregulars will be there fighting alongside Kilvar and the group. Kilvar's sister will be one of the anonymous Black Masks. The party can try to find Kilvar and make it back to the river, they can try to sneak through the battle (and then see Root going further down into the city) or they can fight their way through the district. About half-way through the battle, if the PCs are fighting, the Risk Eaters will arrive in force to kill them and more will arrive until the PCs ar dead. If they sneak and follow Root, when they catch him (maybe not until he reaches Runduum's Hall) he will give them his spiel before cooperating or being forced to give up the map he's using to find Runduum's Hall to raise Aarok from the pool of Magma there - where Aarok last worked his magic in the world before his last sleeping. He needs the bones so he can toss them into the lava and summon a magma elemental with all of Aarok's identity and powers. This option will also let them see Jem's last stand in the main square of the floor, surrounded by weeping humans, statuary of dwarven heroes, and piles of Black Mask bodies.

***If the party follows the river to seek Gotnafiskr,*** they can squirm though the gate where the river flows down off the second floor and brave the rapids in the dark, making 5 acrobatic checks and suffering injuries on botches against a 6. After moments that feel like hours of downing near death, they'll wind up in a dwarven-made pool (with a drain feeding back into pipes feeding back into the river on the second level). The pool will be in the Chamber of Need. PCs can examine the cystals spires, share what they think the dwarves need, and make a decision about giving up parts of their identities to become more like that. If they do, they finish their individual nightmare stories from past session notes. This is where you should warn them about the body horror in the dreams and let them line, veil, or X anything they want. 

#### Runduum's Hall

The next room will be Runduum's Hall where the seneschals will ask the party their questions before unlocking the magma flow that will raise the city of Aarok (as detailed in past session notes). Root will arrive as the magma pool at the opposite end of the hall begins to drain and attempt to raise Aarok. The Red and Silver Masks will be with him. 

Kilvar will reappear here with his sister and Jem, fighting a retreat against Risk Eaters as they also pursue Root.

Root will deliver his spiel.

Gotnafiskr may or may not breach they magma pool and bite him in half. If Root falls, it will become clear through their grieving that the masks knew him - they are his daughters.

If the party defeats Root, Gotnafiskr will tell them to throw Aarok's Bones into the receding magma and then exhort them to go to Black Lake to join her at the City of Aarok.

If the party joins Root, Gotnafiskr will breach and attack. If the party survives and the PCs have unlocked the seneschals, Root's spies will tell him something is happening at Black Lake. If they did not, Root will raise a fully realized magma elemental avatar of Aarok to help drive the humans out of Denokta from below.

#### The City of Aarok

See also: past session notes.

Unlocking the seneschals in Runduum's Hall will release the magma needed to flow under Black Lake and make the steam needed to raise the City of Aarok, the city Aarok, Gotnafiskr, and Runduum engineered together with his people as a home for the dwarves in a time of need.

What happens when they party arrives, if they survive the session, depends on whether they ultimately aligned themselves with Gotnafiskr or Root.

#### The end of the beginning

Depending on how things turn out:

- ***The PCs may be dead.***
- ***Gotnafisrk may have won.*** Her martial form will rise from the Black Lake as she guides the PCs through the city and offers them rewards.
  - The PCs may leave their service or stay.
  - Wally can become a seneschal of her library and become a demigod of dwarven identity on Cineris, able to infuence it through its flora and fauna.
  - Paslt can leave for Sphere to join Naardor, Embery, and Cantor there as her vanguard of agents agaist the Risk Eaters.
  - Ob and Kilvar can become captains of their own companies of raiders along the coasts.
  - Faelin can dictate the terms of the human surrender and evacuation (to Sphere or the Wasteland or the Elvish Forest) and remain as an ambassador to the elves.
  - Goatnafiskr will sink inbound ships to keep the Risk Eaters off Cineris until this war is over and a more permanent solution can be found to th thret they pose.
- ***Root may have won after the PCs unlocked the seneschals and threw Aarok's bones into the magma.***
  - The PCs may leave his service or stay.
  - His spies will alert him to something happening at Black Lake.
  - He will lead the PCs there, find the seneschal form of Aarok, and become Aarok's regent, King of the Dwarves. Aarok will be his muse and the muse of his artificers.
    - Wally can become his chief artificer, finding ways to combine the magic of the land with the crafts needed to defeat the humans. His first assignment will be to learn how to restore the Black Masks and strangers to their former selves.
    - Paslt can lead his network of spies or govern the Wasteland from Stoneshaper Keep.
    - Ob and Kilvar can go to work for the Red Mask, tracking down human threats in the loose in Cineris.
    - Faelin can dictate the terms of the human surrender and evacuation and remain as an ambassador to the elves.
- ***Root may have won before the seneschals were unlocked, successfully raising a fully realized magma elemental avatar of Aarok from the magma pool in Runduum's Hall and Aarok's Bones.***
  - The PCs may leave his service or stay.
  - Aarok will help Root rid Denokta of humans and chase them out into the plains of Denokta.
  - He will invite the PCs to help him rebuild the homelands and continue Magmatic there.
    - Wally can become his chief artificer, finding ways to combine the magic of the land with the crafts needed to defeat the humans. His first assignment will be to learn how to restore the Black Masks and strangers to their former selves.
    - Paslt can lead his network of spies or govern the Wasteland from Stoneshaper Keep.
    - Ob and Kilvar can go to work for the Red Mask, tracking down human threats in the loose in Cineris.
    - Faelin can dictate the terms of the human surrender and evacuation and remain as an ambassador to the elves.

#### Root's spiel

- The dwarf of my age.
- A visionary.
- Held the Risk Eaters at bay.
- Engineered the humans' defeat.
- Would have gone further, faster, without you and your god interfeing with me and mine.
- Offered you a chance.
- The things I've discovered I've shared and used. Can your god say the same?
- Can Gotnafiskr offer you any of this?
- What I've done I can learn to undo - the Black Masks were a means to an end, but once we are vitorious, we will find a way to restore them. 
- Aarok is my muse.
- A future of finding out what we can do instead of being told what to do.
- I will end the Risk Eater threat to Cineris, Subterra, and everywhere.
- Your last chance to achieve a victory we engineered - one in which we manipulate the gods; they do not manipulate us.
- We have all made it this far; we have all done impossible, heroic things. Do we go foward together, or does this journey end here for some of us?

Gotnafiskr will claim that these are easy lies, as easy for Root to invent as are the devices he unleashes on dwarves and the world. He will become a despot and Aarok will be bound to his need, not to all of the dwarves' need for liberty. What happens when what Root wants becomes different from what the dwarves need?

## Outcomes & rewards

See "The end of the beginning" above.

***If the PCs die after completing the Chamber of Need,*** (except for poor Kilvar) narrate a scene in which they awaken to darkness, and then to a softly glowing blue-green light that they follow to a doorway in the dark. They cannot pass through, but they can see one another standing in other doorways across a dark chamber made of stone. These are their soul fragments from the Chamber of Need. They are the heroes who will be called on again in dwarves' time of need. Time passes, they have no idea how long. A torch. Foot steps. Peering eyes. Two sets. Someone who looks like Kilvar, but impoissibly old. Someone who looks just like him, but a woman. "My friends. My friends who I need...."

***If the PCs survive and they choose to leave the victor's service,*** each victor will grant each PC a relic as a reward.

### Gotnafiskr's relics

- Faelin: a sword with a petrfied wooden blade and a stone handle set with sapphires. A symbol of an ancient alliance between King Runduum and an elvish hero who came to his aid. Its name is Earthheart.
- Ob: A gauntlet spiked with teeth from their last form, armor piercing, +1 damage, close/grappling.
- Kilvar: A dagger made from one of their scales with all of their knowledge inside that can decrypt anything it touches if the keyword is in their long memory.
- Wally: *My King*, Runduum's biography, encrypted so only Wally can read it.
- Psalt: A singed, black twine necklace with a black leather pouch of some dust from Aarok's Bones.

### Root's relics

- Faelin: a mask like Wally's that always rools against 4s.
- Ob: a crystal eye that can store any word it sees and the decrypt anything encrypted with any of those words; needs to be implanted.
- Kilvar: a sister sword to Jem's, the Red Prison.
- Wally: a recipe for synthesizing shards.
- Psalt: a crystal inlaid tower shield that can bounce a siege shield with a radius of 5' against 4s.

## Insterstitials (between-the-scenes)

- See the Chamber of Need nightmares from [session-8.md](https://github.com/chadsansing/cineris-campaign/blob/master/gm-notes/session-6-spoilers.md).
- *"Psalt, you never imagined seeing the humans defeated in your lifetime. Explain why not and then ask any group member how things used to seem to them before this adventure."*
- *"Ob, you never told the story of how you came to be hired to kill Root Stoneshaper. Share it with the group in a moment of reflection."*
- *"Kilvar, you never imagined finding your sister again, and you're working out a way to talk with one another until you can reverse her condition. Tell someone in the group a question she has about them and how she responds to their answer."*
- *"Wally, you never imagined you'd learn so much about your people and land. Tell the group the story of another god you remember hearing about from a family elder when you were young and ask someone in the group if they would help you go looking for them once all this is over."*
- *"Faelin, you never imagined you would be who you have become. Tell the group who you are and what you must do next and ask any group member if they will join you."*
