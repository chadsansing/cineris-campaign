### Important NPCs

#### Jem Brighthelm

Jem is a fighter, weapons designer, and former Magmatic artificer. She is also a true believer in Aarok and Gotnafiskr and the current keeper of Aarok's Bones.

She is raising a force of irreuglars to prevent Root from carrying out his plans in Denokta. She wants to kill Root and serve as Aarok's chief lieutenant in the war to reclaim the dwarven homelands.

Right now Jem and 24 irregulars recruited from around Portia and Magmatic are pusuing the "small caravan" heading west from Portia to Visus. She is in contact with the PCs through their blue crystal shard network.

See also: past session notes.

#### Aarok & Gotnafiskr

Gotnafiskr is the dwarven god of tempering, finishing, endings, trial-by-crisis, and water. They are a parent of the dwarves, as is their partner, Aarok, the Molten Dread, god of beginnings, necessity, invention, fire, and dwarven survival. 

Gotnafiskr is the characters' patron and will encourage them to deal with the small caravan and then make their way to Denokta before Root arrives.

Aarok is being raised by ritual magic performed by Magmatic staffers; they are not yet fully formed on Cineris. Aarok typically "sleeps" whenevever the dwarves forget them or don't need them, losing their last form. They must be raised anew by need in every age. Gotnafiskr keeps one of their forms and sleeps, but is woken whenever the dwarves begin to raise Aarok so Gotnafiskr can see what Aarok begins and then finish it.

Aarok is bound to those that summon him. Gotnafiskr disapproves of Root Stoneshaper, the current mogul of Magmatic (a crystal shard, fashion, and accessories company ouf of Portia) because Root takes shortcuts in his work to overthrow the humans, and his shortcuts destroy dwarves' identities. Gotnafiskr wants to kill Root, bind Aarok to the dwarves' need to return home, and lead the war to drive out the human invaders from Cineris. Gotnafiskr hates Root and is jealous of his hold over Aarok.

Gotnafiskr also wants to free themself from their sleeping place under Denokta, raise the City of Aarok with the help of King Runduum's court of iron seneschals, and then rally all of the dwarves on Cineris to their cause to finish the campaign of liberation started by Aarok and Root.

#### Root Stoneshaper

Root is the mogul of Magmatic, a crystal shard, fashion, and accessories company in Portia. Root's true ambition is to raise Aarok, become his priest and handler, and lead the dwarves in overthrowing the human occupation of the dwarven homelands on Cineris.

Root's work - and the work of his artificers - is wildly edgy as compared to dwarven tradition. He runs Magmatic's R&D department kind of like DARPA, and he may even be doing this work for the Risk Eaters. He has survived for a long time beinding magic and craft in unexpected ways. It's not unlikely that he has a deal with the Risk Eaters to give them his technologies in return for the space he needs to prepare and execute a campaign against the human occupiers of the dwarven homelands on the continent of Cineris, far from Sphere. 

Cineris and Sphere are aware of each other and have some contact and trade, but the distance between them and the bad luck (i.e. Risk Eater sabotage) experienced on most passages keeps them relatively aloof from each other except for the odd shard-enabled relationship or two.

Root and his chief lieutenants, the Red Mask and the Silver Mask, are traveling to Denokta, the occupied capital of the homelands, to give the signal for his Black Masks to launch their decapitation attack against human leadership.

These Black Masks will shard warp into Denokta through the Magmatic Black Oath personal shardscape crystals Root has been smuggling in as bribes to the human elite. One last shipment is on its way - in the small caravan pursued by Jem and the PCs - and then Root will be ready to strike.

What makes everyone hate Root the most is that the Black Masks are dwaves he has conditioned by making them into Strangers. He destroyed their faces (Dissemble), voices (Babel), and identities, and then made them survive together in shadow chambers to become elite fighting units by overcoming the fears and terrors that made them who they were.

He wants the humans out at any cost and the glory that comes with such a victory. That he cannot separate his need for glory and seeming clever from the dwarves' need for liberty is his tragic flaw. Even though he has destroyed hundreds of "every dwarves," he thinks he should be lauded as the every dwarf (albeit a clever one) who saved Cineris.

It's probably woth noting that his daughters are the Red and Silver Masks, that they went through the conditioning as guinea pigs, and that Root gave them back their voices so they could serve him. They are bound to him.

## Story

### Background

We are withing striking distance of closing this part of the campaign. A lot depends on PCs' decisions. The end game in Denokta and the City of Aarok is described in past sessions and will be outlined below under "Exploring Denokta." The cliffhanger will be the moment between dealing with Root and assaulting the humans.

Having escaped the Magmatic ambush on Mount Cineris, the PCs and Jem Brighthelm return to Portia to regroup.

They learn that Root has sent 2 caravans out of the city, A small, but heavily guarded, caravan left from the west gate, headed towards Visus. A big caravan of several dozen wagons and +/- 500 troops left the north gate, but the PCs don't know where it's going.

Jem leaves the group to begin raising a force to stop Root. She has the Bones of Aarok to help her compel dwaves to serve her cause. During this session (and beyond, if she survives) she is a strategic asset the PCs can use as a mercenary force.

The PCs hire elvish scouts to watch Kilvar's Pass for signs of the big caravan. They also hire dwarven scouts to search for the big caravan in the wasteland. Finally, they hire a spy in the halls of power of Denokta to help them understand what's happening there. The PC's spy in the Magmatic cult of Aarok is still alive and reporting, as well.

### Scenes

#### Raiding the small caravan

Jem and her irregulars spot the small caravan using Sprite Scouts. They contact the PCs by shard or Messenger. The PCs can ask Jem to wait for them and then deal with the caravan together, or the PCs can send Jem's force to raid the caravan.

Either way, Jem's force will win deciseively as she becomes more confident in using Aarok's Bones to exert her will over other dwarves.

The 2 wagons carry a priceless treasure of gemstones. These gems go to banks in Denokta that extend Magmatic credit to help feed the dwarves, pay their employees, and purchase raw goods for its work.

The wagons have false bottoms. In each there are 2 boxes of 20 Magmatic Black Oath personal shard scape crystals (4 x 5 cases). Each is in a velvet bag embroidered in gold with its brand name and the instructions, *"Just say, 'and the stars will be your eyes' to begin."*

These are super dangerous. Each is keyed to a Black Mask ready to shard warp to the crystal at Root's order. If anyone is sureveilling the network, they can see everyone near one of these crystals, as well.

#### News from the field

After the PCs decide what to do about the small caravan, their spies report in via messenger.

- The elvish scouts have seen nothing at Kilvar's pass.
- The dwarven scouts have tracked the big caravan to Ash Lake. The Dwarves are converting the wagons into rafts and punting an assult force downrive that should arrive in Visus by nightfall.
- The Denokta spy has never heard of a black shard, but says those small caravans full of gems for bribes and credit have been coming in regularly from Magmatic for months.
- The Magmatic spy reports that they have been placed on rotating guard duty around the ritual magic chamber in Stoneshaper Keep's basement. Every half hour has has to report in via Messenger to one aupervisor and via shard to another, and somehow his responses have to match up. Each day he gets a list of the passphrases he has to memorize and then burn in front of a third supervisor. He us on duty for 4 hours at a time.

The PCs should determine what to do next.

#### Drowning Visus

If the PCs go to Visus to get across the bridge and head for Denokta, they will arrive at nightfall. The bridges will be up. The human district of the city will be engaged with an amophibious dwarven attack force coming from the river off of the big caravan's wagon-rafts. The dwarven district will be firing arrows and pitch across the river, as well.

The PCs can try to join the fray or sneak into the sewer system to get to the river to get to the sewer system on the human side to get to theie safe house. If they want to get to Denokta, they have to make it through somehow or swim. *The Weeping Angel* is not available. The PCs don't know this, but Naardor is taking Embery and Cantor to Sphere to escape Root and start some kind of new business together as peaceful artisans. Or at least that is what Naardor hopes.

If the PCs simply cannot figure out a way through the chaos, Gotnafiskr will intercede by sending a wave down the river and another from the sea to drown the human district of Visus.

The PCs may or may not encounter the Captain while in or around Visus. He will give them 30 minutes to broker a cease fire or, barring that, attack them.

#### The road to Denokta

Once the PCs make it past Visus, they can follow the road to Denokta, though they wull have to get through the border outpost somehow. They will have to out-race news from Visus or figure out disguises or cover to get through. Bribes will help.

Otherwise, this is a good time for intersitials (see below).

#### Exploring Denokta

Root's part of the end game happens in Denokta. Scenarios are described in past sessions. Here is an outline of what might happen.

- Travel through the homelands and the slums and camp cities outside Denokta. Little military.
- Arrive at level 0; pay a toll; enter the city. Some miliary.
- Enter level -1, the first underground district full of low-income housing and support services. Some military.
- Descend to level -2, the warehouse district. An underground river rings this district. It is Gotnafiskr's sign. It enters through a waterfall and leaves down another. The PCs can jump down that waterfall and risk a critical or mortal wound to reach the Chamber of Need. Heavy military.
- Level -3 is where the Black Mask assault will begin. This is the government and elites disctrict with the offices, services, parks, shaopping, and other luxuries one would expect. Heavy military. This is a good place for Kilvar to find his sister, one of the Black Masks, who tries to communicate by playing an old childhood game with him, Crows Bones.
- Level -4 is a crystal mining level. Heavy military.
- Level -5 is a crystal mining level. Heavy military.
- The humans haven't made it any further yet. A mix of riches and Dwarf Fortress horror awaits them below.
- The Chamber of Need would be the equivalent of level -9 or so.
- Ruundum's Hall would be the equivalent of level -10 or so.

The Chamber of Need gives PCs the chance to reinvent themselves by exchanging part of their soul for part of a hero's soul trapped in one of the chamber's giant crystals. King Runduum, a worshipper and servant of Aarok and Gotnafiskr, collected parts of the souls of his followers and prisoners in case dwarves needed them in the future. 

The GM asks each PC to describe who they see in the crystal when they think of what they need the most right now. The PCs invent names and histories for their visions. Then they can reach out to the visions or not. If they do, the enter a process of becoming both heroes at once while some of their soul goes into the crystal to make room for what they take.

Nightmares accompany this process. PCs have to opt in to this functional re-spec; a nightmare has been written for each in past session notes. Some feature horror that should be facilitated with care and with X/line/veil tools in PCs' hands to end or skip the scenes.

Runduum's Hall is where Runduum and 3 other iron seneschals (masterwork oracles) await the PCs to unlock the pipes that will send magma under Black Lake, causing the deep waters to become steam and raise the City of Aarok in a moment of dwarves' need. When the pipes are unlocked, Gotnafiskr is also frred to swim to Black Lake and emerge in her martial form.

This hall has a pool of magma on one side against which the PCs will find Root and the Red Mask and Silver Mask attempting to summon Aarok from the magma.

The PCs can kill Root, or Gotnafiskr can breach the magma and snap him in 2 pieces that land at his daughters' feet (the Red and Silver Masks). They will mourn in a way that implies some kind of connection bewteen them and Root, and then turn on the PCs to commit suicide by combat.

If the PCs have time to go to Black Lake after resolving Denokta (do the humans evacuate? Do Jem's irregulars work with the Black Masks to slaughter them?) they will witness Gotnafiskr's martial form rising from the lake and see the City of Aarok rise, as well.

This part of the campaign should end with some rewards for the PCs. Maybe treasure. Maybe serving in the city. Maybe being made into a seneschal. 

The next part of the campaign will deal with the Risk Eaters plans for Cineris, what it's like to live during an age of Aarok and Gotnafiskr, the attack on the human invaders, and what kind of future there is on Cineris if the dwarves win.

## Outcomes & rewards

See past sessions for descriptions of Aarok's Sword, Aarok's Bones, and the Bloody Warden. Wally may use the sword this session, and Jem may give up or be compelled to give up the bones and her claymore, the Bloody Warden.

The characters may choose to carry black shard scape crystals with them, but they are inherently risky. Eventually, on a signal from Root, the Black Masks will shard warp through those crystals. The "small caravan" smuggling these crystals will also have a priceless cargo of gemstones.

The party may loot Magmatic guards, Jem's iregulars, Black Masks, or other slain allies and enemies they encounter in the wasteland or in Denokta.

## Insterstitials (between-the-scenes)

- *"I once saw a wave like that," or, "I wonder what other powers Gotnafiskr hasn't shared with us yet."*
- *"Those gems give me the shivers," or, "What do we do about Magmatic after this?"*
- *"Why haven't the Risk Eaters just ended Root?", or, "Are we putting ourselves in even more danger by killing Root?"*
- *"What do you think Gotnafiskr's sign will be?", or, "Where do you think Gotnafiskr really is?"*
- *"So, does Jem get to keep the bones forever?", or, "I kind of want a turn with those bones."*
- *"Wally, you have questions about what the elves and humans think about all this. Ask Faelin what the elves know or who the humans worshiped to help them conquer the dwarves; Faelin, invent some lore for your answer."*
- *"Ob, you heard Kilvar talking in his sleep last night. Tell him what you heard and ask him what he was dreaming. Kilvar, tell us about your dream."*
- *"Faelin, beards seem super weird to you. Ask Wally to explain what some of the different dwarven beard knotting techniques mean. Wally, invent some lore.*
- *"Kilvar, you've having a great time battle-bonding with Ob. Explain what it's like and then ask Paslt if he ever had a partner. Psalt, respond however you'd like."*
- *"Psalt, you notice that Ob has a bit of something hanging from his chin. Let him know so he can brush it off. Ob, tell us all about whatever is hanging from your chin and share how it got there."*
