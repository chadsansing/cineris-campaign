# Cineris campaign inspirations


Bits and pieces of this campaign came to me from:

- "Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra" from *Star Trek: The Next Generation*
- *Star Trek: Discovery*
- *Dune* by Frank Herbert
- *The Family Trade* series by Charles Stross
- "Far from Any Road" by Handsome Family
- "Krigsgldr" by Heilung
- Norse mythology
- *The Quantum Thief* trilogy by Hannu Rajaniemi
- *Remembrance of Earth's Past* trilogy by Liu Cixin

I ran a previous 4th Edition D&D version of this campaign for the Community Public Charter School's D&D club in 2013. It focused on the dwarven ruler of Portia, a worshipper of Aarok, as the main antagonist, supported by the Red and Silver Masks. That quest line essentially ran due west from Portia to the Ash River mine to the border to the human capital to its underground to the campaign's resolution, so parts of this version will, of course, seem familiar to players in that campaign.

Here are some of the notes from that earlier campaign:

New content for the 2018 campaign includes everything Cryptomancer brings to the table as a game, along with Gotnafiskr, Root and Magmatic, the 5 artificers, and Dril.
