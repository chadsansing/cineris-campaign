### Important NPCs

#### Root Stoneshaper, dwarven mogul

Root is a potential patron for your PCs.

Root Stoneshaper is the dwarven magnate who runs Magmatic Makers. His company has pioneered Golem shop attendants, shopping and currentcy-exchange on the Shardnet, and Golem delivery. Magmatic sculpts high-end shard nets and markets precious decorations and cases for them. They also make glamored clothing that looks like armor in the distinctive Magmatic colors and sleek style, as well as low-level magic accessories like shadow pouches.

Root maintains a private shardnet of red crystal shards distributed amongst his executives and cloaks. These shards are considered badges of office for elites in Root's circle.

Root uses his commercial empire and catalogs and auctions and advertising on town square boards to encrypt instructions for his employees and agents.

Root has a passion for especially powerful magical artifacts.

Root will portray the artificers as disgruntled ex-employees who illegally stole his company's trade secrets and technologies. His missions will be about getting those technologies back by bribery, intrigue, or violnce.

Root presents himself as a business man who is happy to trade with dwarves, elves, and humans. He frequently, publicaly characterizes trade as the best way to achieve peace and describe the real borders of value exchange that exist between different people.

Root is secretly a priest of Aarok, the Molten Dread, an ancient, nearly forgotten dwarven necromancer and forge master revered as both a god of chaotic renewal and dwarven nationalist hero.

Root is assembling a number of especially powerful artifacts to create an underground Shardnet dead zone in which he can raise and equip an army of dwarven nationalists under Aarok's banner to defeat the humans on Cineris and fight off any Risk Eater assault. While he presents his plan as a nationalist dream to his secret followers and closest confidants, his motivation is to rule as Aarok's notional heir.

The cloaks killed by the Risk Eaters at the beginning of this session were working for Root and betrayed to the risk eaters by Dril, who has compromised Root's network of red shards.

#### The Red Mask, right hand to Root Stoneshaper

The Red Mask is Root's enforcer. Violence and death follow them. They wear a translucent, but not transparent, ruby half-mask (with its largest facet over their face), as well as a cloak and set of scale armor that disguises their true identity.

The Red Mask is secretly Root's youngest daughter, Cora.

#### The Silver Mask, left hand to Root Stoneshaper

The Silver Mask is Root's spy master. Their presense is seldom detected, except by Root's side. They wear a curved, flat, mirror-polished silver half-mask, as well as a cloak and set of chain armor that disguises their true identify.

The Silver Mask is scretly Root's eldest daughter, Ada.

#### Dril, silent partner

Dril is a potential patron for your PCs.

Dril is a dragon-in-hiding who uses the Shardnet and agents to steal prescious treasures, smuggle goods, manipulate markets, and otherwise influence the lives of man.

Dril's greatest desire is to ensure their own survival and avoid the Risk Eaters.

Dril has agents within Root's red shard network that have allowed him to discover Root's true nature and plans for the future.

Dril wants to get the artifacts that Root is after before Root does.

Dril's missions will be about finding the artificers, discovering what technologies they have, and discovering why they left Magmatic.

#### Petra Bladebender, the first artificer

Petra Bladebender is an ex Magmatic employee who left to set up her own jewelry business for rich clientele. She is an especially gifted sculptor of shards and shard networks and has discovered ways to further entangle shards from the same source to behave as if they were cells joined together in largr organism.

Petra left Magmatic because she felt Root was overbearing and creepy towards her. She also disliked his greed and felt sure she could make more of a name for herself and her art (and get more money) working on her own.

Petra has created a kind of invisibility cloak from incredibly light and thin scales shaved from the same source of shards. The scales all talk with one another to share information about what they each "see," and then they work together to compile and display what they see in near real-time on the surface of the cloak.

Root wants the cloak for himself. Dril wants the cloak to study how he might make his own or build a lair from scales like those in the cloak.

## Story

## Background

The PCs should play any type of character they'd like. Their back stories should all have them in Portia for some reason at the start of this session.

By chance, the PCs errands have all brought them to a quiet intersection of alleys near the market district where they witness the sudden apparition of a Risk Eater in front of a small band of dwarves who seem to be fleeing straight into its sword.

Key outcomes:

- PCs join forces with a patron or decide to go it alone.
- PCs establish a safe house with their patron or on their own.
- PCs learn about Root and Magmatic, Dril, and the artificers.

## Scenes & narrative flow

### Scene 1 - The Streets of Portia

"Fate, chance, or something more sinister has brought you all to this corner of Portia on this day at this time. You hear quick, urgent shouts echoing through the alleys, then running footsteps, then the jostle and clink of armor and arms."

"From up the alley leading back to the market district, you see 3 dwarves barreling headlong towards you."

"They pull up short and draw arms as the walls between you and them seem to warp at impossible angles, and a Risk Eater appears. It looks lithe and massive at once with skin that crawls in patterns of crytals, geometirs, inks, and scars and a face you cannot see to understand apart from its piercing eyes. The Risk eater gives you a slow look with its head title to one side before snapping forward a whipping reed into the dwarves midst, blades suddenly in-hand and whirling."

"The dwarves last a few minutes, which surprises you. They are excellent fighters and manage to wound the Risk Eater several times, but it is relentless and seemingly disregards its own safety to get inside the guard of each dwarf and stab and rip them to death."

"Then there is a strange thing; the last dwarf to die seems to stutter in an impossible quick movement. They stepped into the Risk Eater's attack and are impaled on its dagger, but then they seem to step backwards and glash forwards again, back onto the blade, but this time with adaager drawn and plunged into the Risk Eater's chest. He lets out a whisper."

PCs can make a Wits/Tracking check.

*"Gotnafisker."* This will be half of a soul-name, true-name encryption scheme later in the campaign.

"The Risk Eater pulls its blades from the dwarf, staggers backwards, falls to the ground, and begins inching its way down the alley towards you."

After witnessing the attack, the PCs have several choices.

- A. They can try to finish off the Risk Eater.
- B. They can search bodies for clues.
- C. They can wait and observe.

***If A...***

Use the wounded Rik Eater stats above for the fight. If threatened, the Risk Eater marshals its strength to attack. PCs can search bodies afterwards; if they take a while doing so, 2 of Root's cloaks will show up and ask them to follow them to Stoneshaper Keep.

***If B...***

The PCs can cautiously press themselves against the alley walls and make their way around the Risk Eater to search the dwarves bodies. If they do, they find curious red shards and a number of accessories - pouches, boots, hilts - stamped with the Magmatic brand icon.

The PCs can pass Wits/Craft checks to identify the brand and track down local resellers, where they will eventually be found by Stoneshaper's cloaks and invited to the Stoneshaper keep.

The PCs can also pass Wits/Craft checks to see what they already know about Magmatic and perhaps even find their way to Stoneshaper Keep on their own. The PCs might know that Magmatic:

- Sells high-end shard accessories and decorations.
- Sells fashionable, glamored clothing that looks like sleek armor.
- Sells low-level magic items like shadow cache pouches.
- Pioneered Shard-based commerce and ordering.
- Pioneered Golem shop assistants.
- Pionered Golem delivery. 

Mechants will be able to confirm the brand, talk about Root's wealth and station in Portia (revealing some of the information about Magmatic listed above), and express surprise that the PCs have gotten their hands on a red shard and some skepticism about how they got it.

***If C...***

The PCs can quietly wait and observe the scene. If they do, the will see Root's cloaks arrive soon afer the fight. The cloaks strip each dwarf of a red crystal shard.

The PCs can follow the cloaks back to Stoneshaper Keep or confront them. If the PCs confront the cloaks, they do everything they can to deestcalate the situation and bring the PCs to the keep so Root can debrief them.

If there is a fight, the cloaks try to evade and escape the PCs and can be tracked back to Stoneshaper Keep.

### Scene 2 - Stoneshaper Keep

This scene is largley about negotiation.

Root entertains the PCs in the sitting room of Stoneshaper Keep off of the castle's entry hall. The keep is a strange place if only because it's built like a human castle, but full of dwarven art - raw chunks of precious ores and gems of incredible size; landscapa paintings of the deep underground; sets of armor and arms that defy belief in the artistry of their crafting.

Root is very genial and presents as if he assumes all problems can be solved through his charm, intellect, and money. However, is accustomed to using intrigue and violnce when thwarted.

Root enters with his personal bodyguard, the Red Mask and the Silver Mask.

First, he will negtoiate for the return of any red shard crystals the PCs scavaneged after the Risk Eater attack. He will characterize them as an experiment in cosmetic tinkering with shard crystals for rich clients. They are actually part of a synthetic shard net he has invented and uses with his chief executives, lietenants, and agents. Money; gear; Magmatic credit - he will find the PCs price and pay it without hesitation.

Root will then cite that asy negotiation as a sign of his good will and eagerness to continue working with the PCs. He needs hlp recovering some items and technologies from disgruntled ex-employees who have managed to side-step the law or use it as a delaying tactic against retrning to Root what is rightfully his and Magmatic's.

Should the PCs be intersted, of course they will need an "office" from which to operate and an "empolyer" to pay them for their work. All of that can be arranged with the Silver Mask, should the PCs wish.

The PCs can then...

- A. Accept Root's offer and negotiate with the Silver Mask for a safehouse before their first mission. Root leaves so as not to know the details.
- B. Refuse Root's offer, which Root will seemingly take well, but will cause him to surveil the party and act as it's nemesis if they go after the artificers on their own or for another patron.
- C. Ask for more time, which Root will seemingly take well. The PCs can go and use their money or pass some time in Portia before Root sends cloaks or the Silver Mask to check back in with the PCs (at which point they can choose A or B again, but not C).

***If A...***

The Silver Mask can offer 1 of 3 different safe houses.

- A guard house on Stoneshaper Keep grounds. This is highly visible. The PCs would have to avoid violence at all costs, as well as avoid being discovered during intrigue, if they were an official part of the Magmatic organization.
- A block in the market district Magmatic had been converting into a large commercial space.
- A warehouse Magmatic no longer uses near the port - it's too far off of the optimal delivery routes for Magmatic's goods.

The first assignment will be to find Petra Bladebender, a disgruntled ex-employee who is thought to have stolen a bunch of jewelry designs and raw materials and fled north to ply her trade amongst the more refined elves and wilderness dwarves.

The PCs will also get red shards for communicating with Root's network and the Silver Mask. The Silver Mask will explain that these are shared among Root's executives, lietenants, and agents as a sign of station and that using them like a badge of office sometimes grants access to places and resources others can't get. Root has perfect knowledge of everything sent on this network that is not soul-name or true-name encrypted, can track the shards, and can surveil with them.

The PCs will also get the message from option B on the way out of the Keep. If they talk about it on their red shards, Root will know about their treachery and become their secret nemesis.

***If B...***

Root will surveill the group and become its hidden nemesis if they work for another patron or go after the artificers on their own.

On their way out of the keep, the PCs each get an identical shardnet message to meet a "patron of their craft" by the port that evening.

Dril sent the messaage to recruit the PCs to go after the artificers for him. He will speak to them through a ship's figurehead that is a golem. Dril will offer them a sea-cave safe house near the port that they can get to from the sewers. Dril has the same information about the first artificer as Root has. The PCs should have no idea Dril is a dragon. Dril refers to itself as the PCs' silent partner.

The PCs can also pry the crystals from the figurehead's decorative necklace if they do not have a private sharnet yet.

If the PCs refuse Dril, Dril will become their secret nemesis. It is possible to have both Root and Dril working against the PCs as secret nemeses; it is less possible for the PCs to play them successfully against one another unless they are clever enough to role-play their subterfuge well.

***If C...***

The PCS will get the message from option B on their way out of the keep.

After role-playing some interstitials and/or their interactios with Dril (see below), the PCs will be contacted by Root's cloaks or the Silver Mask and asked for their final decision.

During this time they may try to independently rent a safehouse, secure a shardnet, and investigate the artificers. 

If the PCs refuse both Root and Dril, then they should role-play finding a safe house and shard net and begin their investigation of whatever leads they have, eventually discovering news about recent big-name departures from Magmatic and rumors of one of the former employee's whreabouts.

### Scene 3 - Into the woods

This is largely a world-buiulding and expository scene with light combat.

All of the information or rumors the PCs collect tells them to head north, into the elven forest. 

The PCs can role-play preparations and then try an interstitial as they travel north.

The PCs can interact with traders, travelers, and other residents they find asking after the artificer, who was a conspicuous character to see heading into the forest.

Along the way, the PCs should face an ambush of any 2 random cloaks (combat or magic) sent by their nemesis (if they have one yet). If these are Root's agents, the PCs might find a red shard or the Magmatic icon on their gear.

They should also witness a Gigaphid and elf battle against a Gnoll raiding party.

After getting to the deep forest and some elven communities, they can bribe a Soma addict to discover that a strange dwarf arrived just ahead of them and paid to be taken to a Soma flophouse in a Gigaphid tree another half-day's journey into the trees.

### Scene 4 - The first artificer

This is a scene of stealth, negotiation, combat, or maybe all 3.

After an interstitial, the PCs arrive at the tree.

They climb to the vacant Gigaphid hole where the first artificer, Petra Bladebender, is supposed to be hiding, but see nothing.

A Wits/Deception check will let the PCs discover a strange shimmer. It's the artificer under her invisibility cloak. If the PCs approached stealthfully, she is asleep. If not, she is awake.

The PCs may...

- A. Attempt to buy the cloak, calling in a favor and instructions for negotiation from their patron via shard communications.
- B. Attempt to steal the cloak if Petra is asleep.
- C. Attempt to kill Petra and take the cloak.

***If A...***

Petra is tired of Root, tired of running, and wants to be left to her craft. He cloak is her masterpiece, but she is willing to pay a high price to be free of Magmatic. The cloak can be bought for a ridicukous amount of money. Root or Dril can pay and their agents can instruct the PCs on negotiations via shard. This is a good oppottunity to practice good infosec.

***If B...***

The PCs can steal the cloak with excellent role-play and/or Speed/Stealth checks. IF they fail. Petra wakes up, and the PCs must go back to option A or C.

***If C...***

Petra wakes up as the PCs prepare to murder her in her sleep and fights back, using the stats and spells above. Her primary aim will be to escape with magic and the cloak to hide and live another day.

If the PCs kill Petra, they can make a Wits/Tracking check to hear her last whispers.

*"Aarok."* This will be a major PC later in the campaign.

After some pursuit and successful Speed/Athletics and Speed/Acrobatics checks, the PCs corner Petra and can try option A or C again. Petra will stand and fight when cornered.

Petra's death causes a Risk Eater check; her work is not yet done in their eyes; there are technologies she might yet produce that will help them exert total and perfect control.

### Scene 5 - Meanwhile back at the safehouse

This is a scene of denouement or unwinding for the session.

The PCs should do an interstitial on the journey back to their safe house in Portia.

Once there, they can arrange to return the cloak to their patron through another cell of agents and collect a reward.

If the PCs have no patron, they might try to auction off the cloak to Root or Dril, which would reintroduce the possibility of one being their patron and the other becoming their nemesis.

The PCs could also try to keep the cloak or sell it to someone else. Tricky with the Risk Eaters out there in the world.

## Outcomes & rewards

If the PCs have a patron, in addition to a generous, but not ridiculous, financial reward, the PCs will get a safe house upgrade and cel.

***If Root is the patron...***

- The PCs get a cryptoadmin/handler and a cryptovault in their safe house.
- The PCs get a merchant cell that can launder and move money for them once per session.
- A shardscape crystal.

***If Dril is the patron...***

- The PCs get a library cataloging amazing artifacts, technologies, and research from the past and present.
- The PCs get a cell of corporate spies that can give them a rumor about Magmatic once per session.
- A shardscape crytal.

***If there is no patron...***

- The PCs should role-play their decision-making about the cloak and begin a trophy room or use the proceeds from seeling the cloak to make up to 2 safe house improvements.
- The GM may award the PCs a cell if they role-played any particular contacts well during the session.

## Intersititals (between-the-scenes)

Intersitials are prompts for improvised dialog between scenes. These intersitials give PCs more control over the narrative of the game. They replac GM deescriptions of what happens during travel or downtown with conversational prompts assigned at random to different players.

For example, you might use a prompt like this:

> *"That fight was a lot tougher than I thought," or, "I wonder what bigger plan is at work here."*

And then assign it to a PC. The PC picks one of those two conversational stems and begins a group conversation about it.

After the first conversation ends, assign the next prompt to another PC and repeat that process until each PC has had the chance to lead a conversation during travel, downtime, or any other part of the game you don't absolutely need to narrate as the GM.

You should customie your interstitials to connect with PCs actions and decisions during play.

Possible interstitials for session 1:

- *"I've never seen a Risk Eater that close before," or, "I wonder what made the Risk Eaters attack those dwarves."*
- *"Dwarven magnates are all the same," or, "I used to have this awesome Magmatic tunic."*
- *"How does anyone even get this rich," or, "If I had all that money, here's what I would do."*
- *"If I could get off of Cineris, I would...," or, "This reminds me of the first time I got hacked."*
- *"The humans should never have invaded," or, "The dwarves should never have split up."*
- *"I hate it above ground because...," or, "The first thing I'm going to do when we get back to the safe house is...."*
- *"I never used to do business with people I don't trust," or, "I never trust anyone I do business with anymore."*
- *"So that was a Gigaphid," or, "So that was a Gnoll."*
- *"I've never seen a Soma treee," or, "I can't even remember the last time I tried Soma. No, really."*
- *"Well. This will end badly," or, "Well, that went better than I expected."*
