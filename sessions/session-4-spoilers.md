### Important NPCs

#### Dril, scales in darkness

On Dril: Dril is also Gotnafiskr, Aarok's foil and wife. Dril has been trapped under the sunken city in the caldera of Black Lake for aeons. As Root began his work to summon Aarok through ritualistic worship and the collection of relics to reincarnate the god, Dril awoke to the pain of her husband's awakening from their joint dram/slumber/imprisonment in the world and its memory. Dril used druidic magic and mind write to summon dwarven adventurers and cloaks to the underwater cave system deep under the lake and used them up as tools to construct *The Weeping Angel* and exert her will on the world. Her goal is to free herself or her agents to counter Root's reincarnation of Aarok so she and Aarok can retreat into slumber and shared dream of working great arts with their children. If she cannot do that, she wants to free herself to join Aarok and fight those that wound bind them, with a vague sense of loyalty to her dwarven children - she may be persuaded to help a free Aarok retake the dwarven homelands. However, she will not join a war if Aarok is controlled by Root. She will try to kill Root and free Aarok first.

Dril has found ways to let her closest helpers die so as not to reveal her secrets, but she can pull the strings of a wide network of cels and cloaks to act as a patron on Cineris.

#### Aarok

The Aarok underneath Sootbeard Mine is an early avatar summoned by Root's ritualistic worship to an unknown place of power named, but not understood, in Root's research and magic. He is here because Sootbeard Mine was the home of the original Wasteland dwarves clan - the Sootbeards - who braved the wasteland fot precious metals even before the human conquest. The Sootbeards worshipped Aarok and Gotnafisker and the old ways. This avatar is mostly a magma golem with the nascent will of Aarok, who, influenced by Root's magic, is preparing for war by reforging his sword, Aydok. See [session-3-spoilers.md](session-3-spoilers.md) for details.

PCs can rush this avatar resulting in a lava wave and buried sword; they wan watch, resulting in a melting avatar and unclaimed swaord; they can try to address the avatar and ask questions using skills and talents, and then wind up with one the previous outcomes. This avatar is working in a temple to Aarok with a forge and a pool of water and a mural described in the last session's notes. Mountains --> lake --> coiled sea serpetn --> volcano --> city on its side. Touching the sea serpent trigger's Aarok's jealosuy and a burning bleeding from the fingertips resulting in the loss of 1 HP. All representations of Gotnafiskr carry this curse.

#### Old Embry

Crazed Aarok-workshipping artificer and adherent of the old ways who left Root over his plans to manufacture a future victory against the Risk Eaters. Insane now, Bloody nails, self-inflicted gouges, blood-stained plans, a read crystal shard, rantings about, "Root is watching!", "Aarok is coming!", "The shadows are not empty!", and "The emptiness is full of things we pushed aside!"

Embry is a surviving Sootbeard who came here to hide. The Sootbeards went west to fight the humans, and few made it home; the presence of human miners and workers and dwarves from other families from Visus drove out the rest. The recent necromantic catastrophe of zombie fishmuck has all but shuttered the mine and starved Visus.

Embry learned how to use ritual magic and a variable number of practioners to create large shadow caches the size of rooms and small homes. His plans suggest how to create even larger spaces and that crystals within a cache might still work with one another.

Every living thing and intellignt artifact shut within a cache stands the chance of passing through others as horros, appartitions, attackers. What you perceive there and where you look creates your safety or undoing.

Rolls against 8 (for insanity) may garner some other answers to PCs' questions.

## Story

### Background

See [session-3-spoilers.md](session-3-spoilers.md) and [#10](https://github.com/chadsansing/cineris-campaign/issues/10).

A few updates on Root-lore: he wants to use the homeland invasion to force the Risk Eaters to commit to fighting on Cineris while he sends shard-warpers to Sphere to attack Soma production, cryptowheel dens, and any Cryptarchs his Masks (nee Cloaks) can find. His goal is to hurt Sphere to drive Risk Eaters completely off of Cineris - he believes they were responsible for the human conquest and that it was an attempt to stop the dwarves on Cineris from becoming Risk Eaters' rivals. He wants to hide his army and train it in the shadow realm, arm its Masks with weapons that will steal soul names and unlock more of Sphere's secrets, hide his Masks in cloaks like Petra's, give them all shard eyes to fight better together and see the battlefield as they prepare it with the massive amount of synthetic shards he hopes to manufacture. Masks will also be dissembled to keep them from being recognizeable. That the Red Mask and Silver mask have undergone this ordeal - and that they are Root's daughters - is a terrifying testament to his family's desire for power. Aarok is a political and military weapon to Root, someone he can manage-up; whereas, for dwarves like Embry (too scared) and Jem(a fanatic), Aarok ia a god, even if stories of Gotnafiskr had disappeared before they rediscovered Aarok-worship.

### Scenes

#### Embrey's escape

Once the PCs figure out how to break through the false wall or decrypt it, they will encounter a rasping gray vortex of shadow cache echoing with the signal of the anvil strikes below. Embry will reach a clawed, bloody hand out as if for help and share his mad ravings on exit, clutching his plans and shard to his rent clothes. He may follow the PCs or be killed by them or flee, depending on how the encounter goes.

#### The anvil below

This is the scene with the avatar of Aarok described above and in [session-3-spoilers.md](session-3-spoilers.md). The shrine/temple is full of necromantic energy holding Aarok together and providing him with skeletal, maybe rotting assistants that ignore the PCs entirely. Their demise (when Aarok's avatar dissolves) signals the end of the necromantic catastrophe, and the river will begin to run a tiny bit more clearly immediately.

#### Ambush on the road to Visus

This adventure introduces Magmatic risk at 10% after Embry's shard makes out the adventurers. It goes up 1% per instance of bad opsec near red crystal shards and 2% per Magmatic cloak killed.

- Below 25%, 3 cloaks attack the PCs.
- From 26%-50%, 5 cloaks attack.
- From 51%-75%, Fishhoook attacks (Ob's merchant marine/fisherman frenemy).
- Above 75%, the Red and Silver Masks attack. 

On their exit from the mine, Dril will contact the PCs to warn them that Root has sent cloaks after them and to tell them that Dril has found new leads on the remaining artificers. They should regroup at the safehouse and check a few of the books for references Dril discovered.

3 Magmatic cloaks will ambush the PCs on their way down river.

#### Downtime

At the safehouse, PCs can get and spend TP and SA. They can also find the books on Aarok-worship that Dril recommends.

#### The third artificer

The PCs can set out after the next artifcer. Jem and Cantor are the furthest away, while Hamner is close enough, perhaps, to intecept.

Notes in [session-2-spoilers.md](session-2-spoilers.md) (and recapped in [session-3-spoilers.md](session-3-spoilers.md)) suggest the plot outlines for whichever option PCs choose.

## Outcomes & rewards

After completing the quest line for the second artificer, the PCs should get:

- 1 TP per player.
- 1 TP per hack.
- 2 SA points.

PCs may also have:

- Aarok's sword Aydok (short sword, brute melee, damage +1, melee, short, unarmed melee, ignores damage resistance and sunders armor - does full damage and reduces armor rating and ability to reduce/deflect damage from other weapons by 1 on each hit until the armor is destroyed, magical effect - burns white when swung doing 1 HP to the weilder who drops it unless expecting the pain; weilder can create a glove for safer handling, but 5 swings will eat through almost any material)
- A shard eye and its designs
- Soul Stealer (claymore, brute melee, cumbersome, damage +2, melee, overwhelming, strength 3, 2-handed, captures the soul of its victim and binds it to wielder's service until a new victim is claimed, macabre - everyone nearby hears the victim's keening in their minds, magical effect - darkness surrounds the weapon, dwarven make)
- Synthetic shards and their designs
- Designs for a shadow chamber
