# Cineris session 2 - SPOILER ALERT

***PCs, you should not read past this line of text.***

***GMs, here are notes for session 2 of the Cineris campaign.***

## Agenda

**Note:** See [#9](https://github.com/chadsansing/cineris-campaign/issues/9).

**Time:** 2 hours

1. 

## Props

### Important NPCs

From [session-2-spoilers.md](session-2-spoilers.md):

- Old Embrey (abandon Root for the old ways; return to ancestral home; hide; shadow cache insanity; lots of dead echoeaters in jars outside his room and a few warning glyphs)
- Hamner Dreadfist (sell synthetic shards to highest bidders at Black Lake auction; profit rather than serve Root)
- Jem Brighthelm (liberate Aarok's bones from the Tomb Golem in the mountaints; Soul Stealer great sword; prove more worthy than Root; follow Aarok to retake the homelands)
- Cantor Gravelock (sell prosthetic shard eyes to crypto den cartel; use money to flee Cineris)

#### Aarok's first avatar

This is the volcanic rock/magma/lava form Aarok takes while reforging his sword in the Sootbeard Mine as part of Old Embrey's quest line. If attacked, he charges as a wave of lava that PCs must flee; if left alone, he finishes his work, presents it to the mural, and sinks into a crack in the floor as lava, leaving the sword behind; if Aarok is addressed properly in old dwarven, the GM should improvise an interaction about war, being tired, returning home to find his love.

### Stock NPCs

See [session-2-spoilers.md](session-2-spoilers.md) for:

- Elvish cloaks
- Combat cloaks (dwarven)
- Magic cloaks (dwarven)
- Tomb Golems

## Story

In this session, PCs should:

- Recap character progression since the end of last session and the "First Artificer" adventure.
- Contact Dril and arrange to move to a safehouse in Visus. This means leaving the mounts behind and incurring a 10% Magmatic risk.
- Choose an upgrade for the safe house.
- Research, plan, and embark on the next quest to find another artifcer, as described in [session-2-spoilers.md](session-2-spoilers.md).
- Confront the next artifcer and resolve their quest line.

### Background

The content in [session-2-spoilers.md](session-2-spoilers.md) establishes the context for the next several sessions until the PCs have assembled all the artifacts and deduced Root's plan.

Root should, by then, without further negotiation, realize that the PCs have abandoned him. He will want them dead unless they  can buy back his loyalty with a gut-wrenchingly compelling sacrifice or display of fidelity.

Root is going to get impatient and claim the mantle of Aarok if the PCs foil him, using new technologies to fake Aarok's powers and, perhaps, even his person. If Root cannot raise Aarok from the dead and become his lieutenant, Root will plan his own ascension to dwarven warlord and march on the homelands.

At that point, the PCs will have some options. The preparation and execution of that campaign will take months, if not years, and Root's chances of success will be tied to the technologies and artificers he's able to recover.

If the PCs know Dril is Gotnafiskr by then, they may work to reunite Gotnafiskr with Aarok or to free Aarok from Root's influence or manipulation. The PCs may join Root once they see what's he's doing and try to reclaim the homelands. The PCs may reject the past and try to stop the war, though that seems unlikely. They may become mercenaries or a black ops unit. 

The artifcer questline is their chance to shape the world and battlefields in the next part of the campaign.

### Scenes

#### Moving to Visus

After sharing character progression, the PCs should work with Dril to set up shop in Visus, which makes the Old Embrey quest line a natural, though not certain, next step.

*The Weeping Angel* will take PCs to Visus; they will see how it works. The Golem controls paddle-like limbs under the waterline. They're triggered by a command program encrypted with a key phrase the PCs cannot know. The PCs mounts should be left behind uncless they want to ride through Portia on them, fight some Magmatic cloaks, and ride west.

Once in Visus, they should discover the safehouse upgrade they want. Dril will have made it happen. They also need to deliver the cloak and its designs to Dril. If they leave them on *The Weeping Angel,"* it will take a few weeks to deliver the treasrues to Dril and return to Visus.

#### Zombie fishmuck

Visus is in the middle of a necrotic cataclysm because of the dark energy around Aarok's avatar in the Sootbeard Mine. The PCs may want to investigate; research into the missing artificers may reveal Embrey's connection to the Sootbeard mine, as well.

The new safehouse is in a sea cave past the western, human side of the city.

Scavengers go through the fishmuck daily for not-lethal fish. The zombie fishmuck clogs the delta and mouth of the river and floats on the surface of the surrounding sea.

The dwarven and human sides of the city have pulled up their bridges, each blaming the other for this curse of death.

A human captian is going up the Ash River to pick up his last crew of scavengers who gave been looting the mine. His barge is abvailable for hire if the PCs want to go to the Sootbeard Mine at the river's source. If the PCs wind up on the dwarven side of the city, they'll need to convince both sides to lower the bridge and let them across or they'll need a ship to go by sea. They could try to cross the river themselves or on horse-back, but that seems gross.

The PCs can make small talk with anyone. An old dwarven woman in the muck has the special knowledge/lines: "The godfish is suffering. The ending is not done taking its shape."

#### The second artificer

Use the notes from [session-2-spoilers.md](session-2-spoilers.md) to take PCs on their next adventure.
