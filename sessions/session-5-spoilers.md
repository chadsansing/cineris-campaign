Naardor "Old Naardo" Gearsmith is a senior crafter and executive at Magmatic. After the artificers left, Root sent Naardor to Visus as a Magmatic rep on the dwarven trade council. This was cover for Naardor to intercept Hamner Dreadfist. Hamner got past Naardor, however, and Root told him not to return to Portia without Hamner and the stolen synthetic shards.

Naardor has been waiting in Visus to find a way to either escape Root or recover Hamner's shards.

Naardor is part of Root's circle of Aarok worshipers. He understands how Hamner's shards relate to Petra's cloak, but not to Cantor's prosthetic eyes. Naardor was put in charge of Petra and Hamner's projects, and Root holds him responsible for them. He doesn't know about the other projects.

Petra was Naardor's niece. When Petra left, Naardor had a change of heart about Root's plans to challenge the humans and Risk Eaters at once. In particular, because Petra left, Naardor questions the morality of Root's many experiments, especially his program to create Dissembled masks to use as Shard Stormers against the Risk Eaters of Sphere. Naardor has come to believe that Root is sacrificing too many other dwarves and moving too fast away from traditions of honorable combat and crafterpersonship. He is upset that Root is making it easier to kill more people more quickly with agents who have been striped of their dwarven identities. Root may even have threatened to Dissemble Petra if Naardor can't find Hamner and his shards soon. 

Naardor knows Root sent someone after Petra, but he hasn't heard about what happened to her yet. It would be bad for the PCs if Naardor finds out that they killed her.

Naardor may recognize Wally as a Magmatic employee from Portia and worry about whether or not Root sent him to Visus an assassin targeting Naardor.

Naardor understands Aarok's place in the dwarven pantheon. He also knows that Aarok was married to another god, Gotnafiskr, who balanced and completed his work, and that both were involved with different aspects or steps of creation. He has the 4-circle tatoo of Aarok worship on his left inner-arm - black or brown ring (mountains), blue ring (lake/Gotnafiskr), black or brown ring (volcano), red circle/dot (Aarok/Aarok's temple). If he shares it with the PCs, he will warn them against anyone with 3 black circles and a red dot. He thinks of them as militant extremists or heretics or apostates who want to destroy, rather than create. Masks are often marked with this version of the tatoo by Root and his Magmatic ritualists so they can be verified from the encampments of strangers that they hide in until called. Naardor's Black Mask has the blue and red version tatooed over their original one because of their loyalty to Naardor.

Naardor has a fetsih for the Dissembled, but also a great compassion and love for someone who would become Dissembled to protect Naardor.

If the PCs decode dinner, Naardor will deal with them plainly and Magmatic risk will rise by 1%. If they ignore his suggestions and aren't poisoned, they will go, and Magmatic Risk will rise by 5%. It will rise by 10% if Naardor finds out that the PCs killed Petra. If the PCs ignore Naardor's suggestions and are poisoned, they will probably encounter him at the end of this questline.

#### The Black Mask

The Black Mask is a Disssembled bodyguard to Naardor "Old Naardo" Gearsmith. Root has created a Black Mask for each of the  executives within his circle of Aarok worship. They also spy for Root and have been trained to kill the peopl they're protecting if any of them should turn on Root.

This Black Mask has been turned by Naardor, with whom they are in love, grateful for Naardor's acceptance and affection. This Black Mask has had their origial 3 black circle tattoo covered by 2 black circle tattoo.

The Black Mask will fight to the death for Naardor.

## Story

### Background

The group has just ended the necrotic catastrophe of zombie fishmuck, allowing the dwarven and human sides of Visus to lower their bridges and resume trade up and down the Ash River, to the Sootbeard Mine, and out to sea and other ports.

The human Captain introduced the group to the dwarven trade council as promised in return for their help with the fishmuck. Naardor "Old Naardo" Gearsmith is a Magmatic rep on the council. His role on the council and in this adventure are described above.

The group has been invited to a feast in their honor given by the council and hosted at Naardor's estate. They may be carrying Petra's cloak and plans, as well as Old Embrey's plans, on them. They have not had the chance to alert Dril of their predicament.

More Aarok lore:

Aarok can take the form of a dwarven avatar, but is also the buried city Aarok hidden under the Black Lake caldera, made of insanely tempered volcanic glass preserved in lava, able to rise only if the mechanisms deep under the ancient homelands capital of Denokta can be activated. These are ancient locks guarded by dwarven automata deep under the city, which is occupied by the humans. It is partly above ground and expanding their into the food-producing plains, but also partly underground where the dwarves used to mine crystal. Maybe the homelands were a crater. 

The city was once the capital, but as dwarves grew and learned and explored and expanded, it became a more stolid and stagnant place, weakening Aarok and all memory of him and Gotnafiskr. However, a dwarven king dedicted to the old ways, Ruundum the First, ruling from Denokta, started a project with Aarok and Gotnafiskr to bury the city and temper and shield it with water and volcanic glass made from the Black Lake as Aarok fell into the magma under Black Mountain.

Ruundum wanted to preserve the city should the dwarves need it again, but it was forgotten before the conquest, so dwarves went to the Elvish Forest or wasteland instead of to the city.

Ruundum also worked with Aarok and Gotnafiskr before they slept to create the Chamber of Need beneath his great hall.

Under the underground city is a more ancient royal city last occupied by Ruundum and a few of his descendants; under its halls there is the Chamber of Need, a space for re-spec-ing characters to become the heroes they think they need to be - different facets of themselves are represented in giant crystals there and can swap selves, imprisoning the old in the Shadow realm. Under that chamber is the Great Gear and its locks, a mechanism for raising the lost city of Aarok when the dwarves are in their last hour of need for a mountain citadel near their true birth place, Mount Cineris, where Aarok, the forge of inspiration is a city and home and forge of dwarven dreams surrounded by the tempering, changing, exploring waters and sea serpent form of Gotnafiskr. Aarok is an idea, a place, and a series of Avatars ceated by invention and need whose works are finished into useful tools by Gotnafiskr. If Aarok begins the campaign to retake the homelands, Gotnafiskr finishes it. For later: rising city scene and churning water scene with Gotnafiskr's warrior aspect emerging from it.

These are all some of the many and different ways to conceptualize their relationship and places in the dwarven pantheon.

### Scenes

#### Dinner at Old Naardo's

Dinner should be improvised as a kind of diplomatic scene or genteel interrogation. Naardor wants to know if he can trust the PCs to help him escape Magmatic and has coded a message of sorts into the menu. Naardor will insist that everyone - including himself - leave their shards in jeweled boxes set on a marble buffet inside the dining room as matter of etiquette and decorum during dinner conversation. Daggers seem fine; larger weapons go against the wall.

Naardor will also excuse himself to tell his kitchen what to prepare and serve before returning in more elegant attire with a punch dagger at his belt.

***If Naardor finds out that the PCs killed Petra...***

At any point, if Naardor finds out that the PCs killed Petra, he will expel them from his home and alert Root to their presence in Visus and demand Root deal with them, jumping their Magmatic risk by 10%. Naardor will also show them out even if they decrypt dinner. Once the PCs have learned what they can from Naardor, their Risk Eater risk will rise by 1% as they begin to see more of Root's design.

***If the players decrypt the menu...***

The other moguls will have taken Naardor's suggestions. Those items, working in combination, will poison them and put them to sleep. The moguls will wake in a day or two assuming they are hung over from an excellent dinner party. Naardor will invite the PCs to his libary for after-dinner conversation and deal plainly with the PCs and share what he knows in return for their support. This will leave the moguls and their bodyguards behind in the dining hall; the bodyguards will begin taking the moguls home once it's clear they're passed out for the evening.

***If the players don't decrypt the menu, but don't take all of Naardor's suggestions...***

If the PCs eat and drink a combination of encrypted and poisoned items, they'll be fine since the poison has to be catalyzed with every item Naardor recommends. Naardor will send them home at the end of the night with the other moguls passed out, poisoned by Naardor's recommendations. Naardor will alert Root to their presence in Visus the next day, jumping their Magmatic risk by 5%.

***If the players take all of Naardor's recommendations...***

They will wind up poisoned and asleep, as will the other moguls. Once the moguls' bodyguards take them home, Naardor will have the Black Mask and his household guard put the PCs in his dungeon. Naardor will interrogate them the next day having found Old Embrey's plans in their gear. Naardor will offer them their freedom if they find and return Hamner and/or his tech within 72 hours. After that, Naardor will betray the group to Root, jumping their Magmatic risk by 5%.

***Menu***

Be sure to introduce some pairs in the order they're listed and to introduce others beginnng with the second item instead.

**First course**

*Food*

- Gorma at Palada; wafer-thin deer-jerky with rose saly and pink peppercorn; represents betrayal; something you feed enemies during parlay to betray your friends; Gorma invited enemies to discuss surrender, but instead planned the slaughter of his own army because his king had married his daughter to someone else, even though Gorma loved her
- Wiven's Larder; mushrooms with Echo Eater spume; represents trendiness; Portia chef's creation; a new way

*Drink*

- Rothush; a bittersweet shot that goes from sandalwood to peach; represents complicated feelings of change; toasted at portentious moments
- Whetsum; a cheap, dry lager; something people drink to get drunk and forget

**Second Course**

*Food*

- Utbur's Forge Steaks; charred on the outside, bloody on the inside; represents something improvised from one use to another; when Utbar and his last vassals were besieged in his royal workshop during a coup, supplies dwindling, he used his forge as an oven to feed them and tenderized their last meat rations on his anvil; the feasted before their deaths
- Drowned Fingers; poached finger-like crustacean appendages served on the shell in a fish broth; represents drowning and death by temptation and overreach; hands tempting sailors below

*Drink*

- Vimdrought; soma liquor stored in crystal decanters; gives feelings of clarity, understanding, euphoria
- Kaala 31; a fine red wine; ostentatious & showy

**Third course**

*Food*

- Prospector's Cake; there's a jewel hidden inside; whoever gets it is said to be blessed with long life and good fortune for a year
- Puddle Treat; alcohol-soaked fruit cake; like a hairy buffalo in a sponge cake; something to get you drunk

*Drink*

- Clefthall 74; Clefthall is usually toasted to new business deals; this is a costly homelands vintage, nearly priceless
- Stoneblush; an overly sweet and strong brandy imported from Sphere

***Encoded pairings***

- First course: Gorma at Palada + Rothush - I want to betray Root so this bitterness I feel may become sweet.
- Second course: Utbar's forge steaks + Vimdrought - I see clearly now and am ready and eager to change course.
- Third course: Prospector's Cake + Clefthall 74 - I am ready to make a deal with you despite the cost that I hope recovers lost treasure and helps make it through upcoming troubles.

#### After-dinner conversation

***If the players decrypt the menu...***

Naardor will share his secrets in return for help escaping Root. He will also gift things to the players to help them defeat Root.

***If the players were poisoned...***

Naardor will imprison and interrogate the PCs and then coerce them into tracking down Hamner.

***If Naardor finds out that the PCs killed Petra...***

It will trigger the same consequences described above.

#### Downtime & research

After the PCs get out of Naardor's estate, they can return to their safe house to spend Talent Points and Strategic Assets. They can also restock and research Aarok, Gotnafiskr, and any other plot elements. The GM should be generous with lore  cataloged in previous sessions to keep the PCs enthusiasm and momentum going. The PCs don't need to know everything about all of Root's plans yet, but they can learn a lot about Aarok and Gotnafiskr from the library and find out some information about the remaining artificers, as well, from the Shardscape. At some point, hopefully, the PCs will realize that the GM has never gendered Dril (who may claim any gender or sexuality) or said Dril was a dragon and that Dril may, in fact, be Gotnafiskr. In the current play-through of the campaign, the PCs think Dril is a dragon.

#### The 3rd artificer

After dinner with Naardor, the PCs should choose the next artifcer they want to track down. Hamner might be the clear choice, but the PCs might settle on Cantor or Jem after doing research or contacting Dril.

The other artificers' scenarios are described in [session-2-spoilers.md](session-2-spoilers.md).
