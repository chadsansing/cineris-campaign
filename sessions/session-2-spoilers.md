## Props

### Important NPCs

#### Old Embrey

Old Embrey is one of the 5 artificers.

Embrey is an ex-Magmatic employee who left because the company didn't respect the old ways well enough for his liking. He felt the manufacture of even low-level magic items by dwarves and golems was too dangerous and reckless a thing to do, and that it would bring the Risk Eaters to Cineris to destroy him and Magmatic.

Embrey has found a way to make shadow cache rooms. They are not paticularly stable.

Embrey goes into hiding in an ancestral claim known as the Sootbeard Mine up the Ash River from Visus, the Bridge City. There is an old lady there, in the river's zombie fish-muck, looking for mussels that are still alive. If found and questioned by the PCs, she will only say the god-fish is poisoned and then the end is still taking its shape.

He is hiding in a Maze-encrypted room that he has turned into a large Shadow Cache. If detected and found, he will be seen as insane - time passes differently in the cache realm and he has spent decades in old age fighting for his life against tormentors real, remembered, and imagined. Embrey will think the PCs are specters or maybe Risk Eaters come to get him and may fight or cower, depending on the needs of the party and the scene.

PCs will not get information from him, but he has his red shard and the importance of the room he's in will be clear to those who find it.

#### Hamner Dreadfist

Hamner Dreadfist is one of the 5 artificers.

Hamner wants to get rich off of his invention rather than turn it over to Magmatic as work-for-hire. The rumor is that Hamner is headed west to auction off his stolen technology to the highest bidder.

Hamner has found a way to synthesize shards that work together, but do not connect to ths shard scape or the crystals its souce seeded around the world.

Hamner is heading to the human-controled plains to make his way up the Black River to Black Lake, a caldera lake in a mountain plateau rougly in the middle of the N-S mountain range, and west of Mount Cineris. He's using encrypted messages on town boards to advertise the auction.

#### Jem Brighthelm

Jem Brighthelm is one of the 5 artificers.

Jem was taken into Root Stoneshaper's inner circle of Aarok workshippers and came to believe that she was destined to be Aarok's champion rather than Root. She felt Root's embrace of manufacturing and cryptogear labor betrayed Aarok, no matter what the ends.

Jem is a weapons designer. She stole a prototype great sword she'd been devloping that captured its victims souls if she could utter their true names as she delivered the killing stroke. Root gave her apostates and corporate spies for testing.

She has taken the sword - Soul Swallower - into the E-W mountains to search out the fabled tomb of Aarok and to try to awaken her god, proving her worth and superiority over Root. She dreams of killing Root with Soul Swallower and bing given Magmatic as a reward from Aarok. She can't resist its wealth and is sure she could turn it around back into a successful, artesian corporation.

#### Cantor Gravelock

Cantor Gravelock is one of the 5 artificers.

Cantor is a cryptogear prosthetics expert. She left Magmatic because she wasn't interested in making money off of designing the weapons Root and other descret Aarok disciples kept suggesting to her.

Cantor is heading north, into the Soma Ring of the elvish forest to sell her latest invention off to a cabal of cryptomancers that run a codebreaker farm. She is going to sell them shard-eyes that will let their soma addicts scroll through words at dizzying speeds inside their own heads.

Cantor wants to take the money from the deal to buy a new identity and flee Cineris. She is sure Root will be after her if she stays.

She may become interested in building cryptogear prostheses from Gigaphid parts if she stays in the forst for a long time.

#### Tomb golem

This is a cryptogear tomb that looks like a sarcophagus and comes to life to fight anyone trying to open it. As a last resort, it will cast Maze on itself (difficulty 4) to hide its seams.

The tomb golem Jem Brightblade wants to open is said to hold the bones of Aarok, the Molten Dread.

The golem can be deactivated by voice command if someone knows the true name or soul name of the tomb's contents. The golem will filter that commend through the remains of the deceased to decrypt embedded instructions to stand down and open itself.

## Story

### Background

Session 2 wraps up the first articer episode from session 1 and begins the next adventure to recover the technologies stolen from Magmatic. This session may introduce PCs to the cults of Aarok, the Molten Dread, and his foil, Gotnafiskr, the God Fish.

Aarok is a dwarf who ascended to godhood as the avatar of dwarven identity and master of the forge. He holds dominion over renewal through descruction and transformation by fire. He is a dwarven nationalist hero and the subject of cult worship. He may be reincarnetd during this campaign. If he is, he may choose Root or Jem as a lieutenant and begin a war against the humans, elves, and woodland dwarves, but the targets he chooses and the objectives he pursues will all be mant to help him restore his foil and love, Gotnafiskr. Aarok may not let his lieutenant know this, and if his lieutenant finds out, they may turn on Aarok and try to ususrp his godhood and domains.

Gotnafiskr is a dwarven god embodied by a fish or female figure with wavy hair who represents the unity of the worlds above and below ground. She is the source of water, but also its movement, its ever-changing nature, its destructive power, its wealth in bringing goods to trade over rivers and seas, and its power to temper, finish, and strengthen dwaven crafts. She represents being shaped and strengthened by water into your true form (even if it's dead and drowning). She is the subject of more obscure and infrequent cult worship than Aarok, as male power tropes have elevated Aarok in th dwarven pantheon above all others, although the dwarven gods were meant to serve as foils and complements to one another - the strike of the hammer and the silence in between those strikes.

There is a single, forgotten myth held only among some ancient dwarven clans that Aarok and Gotnafiskr were once married, that the dwarves are their offspring, and that they died together when Mount Cineris erupted and poisoned the wasteland with the heavy metal from the deep earth because humans (Risk Eaters) awoke in the middle of the earth and, ignorant of its beauty, destroyed eveyrthing in their path to get to the surface and spread like magma over the world. There are other stories about their balance, but they have been interpreted by Aarok's followers as stories of strife and conflict, rather than of cooperation and resolution between him and Gotnafiskr.

There is a song about their two ways of seeing the world called Krigsgldr (by Hielung IRL).

Neither cult practices its worship openly. While hundreds, if not thousands, may worship Aarok in secret, fewer than a hundred dwarves still know of Gotnafiskr and keep her faith, as well.

The PCs may also begin to piece together the strategic importance of the technologies their patron wants to recover and ask themselves why the technologies were bring developed in the first place and who knew about each or all of them together. Root's goal is to create a safe zone where Risk Eaters cannot see and to train an army of dwarven warriors there who can destroy humanity on Cineris, and perhaps beyond, in honor - or perhaps, eventually, in place of - Aarok.

Emerging lore: Aarok's avatar is not actually interested in Root's narrative; it wants to restore Gotnafiskr, it's mate. Touching Gotnafiskr's scales incurs the jealousy of Aarok, and your fingers run with blood or maybe get burned.

### Scenes

#### Resolving loyalties

The PCs should get Dril's invitation and decide whom to serve. See [session 1](session-1-spoilers.md).

#### Into the wilderness

See [session 1](session-1-spoilers.md).

#### The first artifcer

See [session 1](session-1-spoilers.md).

#### Meanwhile, back at the safe house

See [session 1](session-1-spoilers.md).

#### The second atificer

The PCs must again decide whom to serve before going after the second artificer. 

***If the PCs serve Root...***

The Silver Mask will contact the PCs through the red crystal shardnet. 

Root will send the PCs after Old Embrey next. As per Embry's description above, he has fled to an ancestral claim - the Sootbeard Mine - to hide in a shadow-cached room.

PCs will have to travel by boat or coastal road to Visus, the Bridge City, to take a barge up the Ash River to the mine. The River is nearly clogged with a black mush of zombie fish-muck. Something is animating everything dead in the area.

Visus is a city split into two districts, each on one side of the Ash River. The human district is west of the river. The dwarven district is to the east. A draw bridge connects the two sides. It is up right now; PCs have to convince the dwarves to let them to a human side to hire a barge.

There is a lot of tension because of the nectrotic cataclysm happening right now.

The city has been a symbol of trade and diplomacy in the past.

One barge, captained by a human, will take the PCs upriver for a small fortune.

The PCs can do intersitials on the way to Visus and on the way up river.

The mine has been sacked. Run-of-the-mill weapons and armors can be scrounged. Astral Eyes or a similar spell will reveal Embrey's tracks into his shadow cached room. It has been mazed. His true name will decrypt the door. He will have the plans for the room and the books descriving the ritual magic needed to make it on him.

He is mad and will babble about enemies past, present, and future, tormenting him and showing him the end of the world, so many ends of so many worlds, and the like. He will fight if cornered, using magic to try to run away before he is killed.

There is a metallic claninging throughout the mine coming from below. Louder the lower you go. Piercing; maddening; terrifying.

If the PCs investigate and descened and perhaps get trapped on the bottom level of the mine, they will eventually discover a lone figure bagning on a forge in the darkness. This is a weak form of Aarok's avatar summoned by the faith of the small number of cultists that follow him now. As he bangs his hammer, his whole body shudders, sheds ash, glows red, and cools black. He is shaping a pick. After a while, he will take the pick and begin excavating a wall. He is digging out the skeleton of a giant fish or sea monster. If the PCs interrupt, he will charge them, looming suddenly into a wave of magma that crashes and chases the PCs. They need to evade the wave or die. This avatar will be spent after this attack. The skeleton will not be discoverable without magic unless Aarok has begun to uncover it. If Aarok crests and disappates, the necrotic cataclysm will be over. 

The PCs can leave Embrey to his madness or take him back to Root (or another patron? or the Safehouse?). Root will promise to take care of him, but impsion him in the Stoneshaper Keep dungeon. Dril will listen to him to extract information and interrogate him otherwise. The PCs might...?

Downtime at the safehouse follows this encounter.

***If the PCs serve Dril...***

Dril will send the PCs after Hamner Dreadfist who has fled west to the human lands. He wants to go up the Black River to the Black Lake, a caldera lake, in the N-S mountains. 

The PCs can do intersitials while pursuing him.

Likely buyers include a syndicate of human crystal miners who want to keep the shards from market and soma dealers who want to operate secretly. The humans want to sell them the synthetic crystals so they can profit without being traceable. The humans are paying the soma dealers to get Hamner to the lake and will buy the shards and deliver whatever Hamner has on him to the soma dealers, as well, with a promise to fulfill future orders from Hamner's plans. 

If Hamner makes it across the border, he will do so with help from woodland dwarves and humans who overrun the wasteland dwarf border post. The PCs will see nothing but dwarven bodies there, but they'll notice that some hav ridiculous, non-sensical beard braidings - these are woodland dwarves in wastland armor who infiltrated and attacked.

The PCs might find woodland dwarf stragglers and fight. They might track Hamner and his escort to the lake and attack or steal or buy the tech.

Hamner will fight if the PCs threaten him. He will sell them the tech if the price is right. He is not big into fleeing.

Dril wants Hamner's synthetic shards to protect his network from Risk Eater surveillance.

However the PCs resolve the situation, Dril will offer them secured shards after the next session. Dril is not interested in Hamner. Root will reward the PCs with riches, but keep the tech. He will imprison Hamner and poison him, Thufir Hawat style, to keep him working for Magmatic. The PCs might...?

***If the PCs serve themselves...***

The PCs can use Wally's knowledge to query after the missing artifcers and find clues as many artifcers as successes they roll for query. Cantor is going to sell prosthetic shard eyes to crypto dens and then use the money to leave Cineris. Root will reward the PCs and take the tech. Dril will eventually replace one of her eyes and offer to do the same for PCs. Root will imprison Cantor and torture here with the eyes. Dril will let her leave on *The Weeping Angel*. Jem is going to Aarok's tomb to prove her worth as Aarok's champion over Root. Jem will fith with Soul Swallower, a sword that consumes victims' true names and keyword knowledge. Aarok's tomb is in the E-W mountains and a tomb Golem surrounds him and will fight anyone who tries to open it, mazing itself as a last resort. Jem will need to be defeated to get the sword. Aarok's bones will mean a lot to Root, but Dril will also recognize them as a relic worth keeping as a bargaining chip.

There is a non-zero chance the PCs will stumble across news of Cantor Gravelock in the Soma ring of the elvish forest when they contront Petra Bladebender and complete session 1. As GM, you should improvise what information they find and whether or not they meet Cantor or have the chance to engage over Cantor's technology on the road.
